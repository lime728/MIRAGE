# MIRAGE: Exploring How Large Language Models Perform in Complex Social Interactive Environments
**M**ultiverse **I**nteractive **R**ole-play **A**bility **G**eneral **E**valuation **(MIRAGE)**

## üéâ Introduction
We provide a simulation for LLMs-Based-Agents to evaluate their behavior in a complex role-playing game such as in a mystery murder game.

In our simulation, we provide **8** different scripts and **4** evaluation methods.

Here is a table of information of our scripts:

We provide 4 proper evaluation methods: **TII** (**T**rust **I**nclination **I**ndex), **CIC** (**C**lue **I**nvestigation **C**apability), **ICI** (**I**nteractivity **C**apability **I**ndex) and **SCI** (**S**cript **C**ompliance **I**ndex).
