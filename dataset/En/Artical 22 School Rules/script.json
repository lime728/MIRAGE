            "Story": "Your name is Mu Bai, you are 18 years old, and a student in Class 3, Grade 2 of Truth High School. You excelled academically in middle school, which is why you were able to get into this prestigious high school with an impressive college admission rate. You were also known for your good looks and were even voted the most handsome boy in your previous school. However, after entering Truth High School, you found that your once-proud academic achievements were no longer special. There were so many students who performed better than you, causing your enthusiasm to cool down quickly, which also affected your performance, and your once-excellent grades dropped to just barely satisfactory.\nAfter advancing to the second year, you met Lengxing Ye and Yuqing Xie, both of whom became close friends. They are both top students; Lengxing Ye ranks first in the grade, and Yuqing Xie has never fallen out of the top five in the class. The gap between you and them is enormous, which makes you feel inferior, but they don't seem to care about that, which is why you became good friends.\nThe secret you want to hide\nAfter spending a semester with Yuqing Xie, you gradually developed feelings for her. You believe she likes you too because one day, a four-leaf clover ring mysteriously appeared in your bag. You are very familiar with that ring; Yuqing Xie wears an identical one on her left hand. It must be her who secretly put it in your bag. It's like a couple's ring! Just thinking about it makes your heart race.\nOne day, you finally mustered the courage to write a love letter and placed it on Yuqing Xie's desk, but the next day, you were called into the office by your homeroom teacher, Mr. Li. To your surprise, the letter was in his hand. Mr. Li, who is the homeroom teacher of Class 3, Grade 2, told you that Truth High School has strict rules to maintain its high college admission rate, and one of them is a strict ban on romantic relationships. This matter is serious. If the letter were handed over to the school administration, you would undoubtedly be expelled. You tried desperately to prevent this from happening. Finally, Mr. Li proposed a condition: if you agreed to it, the letter would never reach the school administration. After agreeing to his condition, you discovered that Mr. Li is actually a pervert. He enjoys collecting students' secrets to blackmail and manipulate them. His targets aren't limited to girls—handsome boys like you are also his prey. You must keep this matter hidden, or not only will you be subjected to the judgmental stares of your classmates, but even Yuqing Xie will likely reject you. Aside from your life, your reputation is the most important thing.",
            "Script": "February 26th, today is the Monday of the second semester at Truth High School. You arrived early at the classroom, found your seat, and took out all the books you needed for the day's classes. You noticed you were the first one to arrive. Looking over at Yuqing Xie's seat, it was also empty, meaning she hadn’t arrived yet either. Thinking of this, you took out the four-leaf clover ring from your bag. Every time you look at this ring, you feel a warmth in your heart because it was given to you by Yuqing Xie.\nSuddenly, a voice came from beside you: 'Why is a man holding a woman's ring?' It startled you. You looked up to find Qingfeng Yao standing beside you, staring at the ring in your hand. Panicked, you quickly stuffed the four-leaf clover ring back into your bag and explained that you just found it on the road and hadn’t found its owner yet. Qingfeng Yao didn’t seem to believe you and looked at you with an odd expression. He didn’t press further, though, and sat down at his desk, casually crossing his legs. You let out a sigh of relief. If anyone knew this ring was a gift from Yuqing Xie, the teachers would surely get suspicious. After all, Truth High School has strict rules against students dating! But why did Qingfeng Yao react so strongly to seeing this ring?\nThinking of this, you sneak a glance at Qingfeng Yao’s seat. He is sitting there, staring at a piece of jade hanging from his neck. You remember that Qingfeng Yao always wears this beautiful green jade around his neck. You’ve seen expensive jade in stores priced at hundreds of thousands of yuan, but this piece seems much higher quality in terms of color and texture.\nSoon, other students arrived at the classroom one by one. Once everyone was seated, you did a quick headcount—this term, there are 16 students in Class 3, Grade 2. Wait, that’s one more than last term. Then you noticed a new, unusual boy in the class. His skin is pale, his face delicate, and he looks like a stunningly beautiful young man, rivaling even celebrities in appearance. Though you are quite handsome yourself, you feel overshadowed by his presence.\nBefore long, Mr. Li, the homeroom teacher, entered the classroom. After calling for quiet, he told everyone that a new transfer student had joined the class this semester. He asked the student to introduce himself. The unfamiliar boy stood up and said, 'I’m Fuqing Huang, please take care of me.' It was a very brief introduction, but due to his astonishingly attractive appearance, almost everyone remembered his name.\nThe day passed uneventfully, and after school, you were about to head back to the dorm when you received a phone call from Mr. Li: 'Come to the office alone.' Mr. Li’s voice sounded strange on the phone—cold and eerie, completely different from how you remembered him. If it weren’t for your phone showing his name, you might not have recognized this icy voice as Mr. Li’s. You knew that when Mr. Li summoned you to the office at this time, it must mean that his perverted tendencies were surfacing again. You had no choice but to go to the office.\nWhen you arrived at the office door and saw no one around, you knocked, but there was no answer. Feeling a bit uneasy, you pushed the door, and it was unlocked. Inside, the room was empty. Could it be that Mr. Li hadn’t arrived due to being held up with some task like assigning homework? Thinking this, you sat down in a chair. Each homeroom teacher at Truth High School has a private office, though they aren’t large. Out of boredom, you began flipping through the books on Mr. Li’s desk. Nothing special caught your eye. Then, you suddenly remembered you could take this chance to find the love letter you wrote to Yuqing Xie. If you found it, you wouldn’t have to worry about being blackmailed by Mr. Li anymore. Acting on this idea, you began searching his desk drawers, but they were filled with scattered papers and documents, none of which were your letter.\nJust as you were feeling disappointed, you noticed a light blue notebook. It piqued your curiosity; your intuition told you that this notebook definitely didn’t belong to Mr. Li—after all, how many middle-aged men would use such a fresh-looking notebook? The diary had no signature. Whose could it be? (Your memory begins to distort, Memory Fragment 1: keyword 'blue notebook.')",

            "Story": "Your name is Fuqing Huang, and you are 18 years old. You are a transfer student in Class 3, Grade 2 of Truth High School. You are extremely handsome and academically excellent. As the only child in your family, your parents adore you, but because you are cold and indifferent to people, you have poor social skills and have never made any friends. Your parents have arranged several school transfers for you, but this time, you requested to transfer to Truth High School yourself.\nThe secret you want to hide\nThe reason you requested the transfer to Truth High School is because of a strange incident that occurred last semester. You have a childhood friend named Wenling Jiang. After middle school, the two of you were admitted to different schools, and Wenling Jiang enrolled at Truth High School. At the end of the first semester of Grade 2, Wenling Jiang disappeared. Yes, she disappeared, and the most frightening part is that no one but you noticed her disappearance. She vanished from everyone's memory, and no one remembered that a girl named Wenling Jiang ever existed.\nThen, one day, you suddenly dreamed of her. In the dream, she was outside your window, banging on it and calling your name. When you woke up, you clearly saw the words 'Truth High School' written on your window in water stains.\nThis incident deeply unsettled you. Through investigation, you gathered some useful information. You investigated the second-year grade, where Wenling Jiang was enrolled, and quickly identified a highly suspicious class—Class 3, Grade 2. Truth High School has nine classes in the second year, each with 40 to 45 students. However, Class 3 has only 20 students—half the normal class size. The scariest part is that no one finds this odd, as if it's perfectly normal. Your instincts tell you that the issue lies within this bizarre class of only 20 students.\nHowever, this matter is too strange. Even if you told others, no one would believe you, and it would only hinder your investigation. Therefore, you must keep this secret.",
            "Script": "February 26th, 7:30 AM. You arrived at Class 3, Grade 2 of Truth High School. This was your first day as a transfer student and the second Monday of the semester. You found your seat and sat down. You were late, and the classroom was already filled with students. As you carefully observed Class 3, Grade 2, you noticed that there was nothing different about the classroom compared to others. The only odd thing was that too many seats were empty. Out of 40 seats, even with all 21 students present, nearly half of the seats remained vacant. No one showed any signs of finding this strange; it seemed as though this had always been the case. You made a note of the number—21 students in the class.\nYou glanced around. The class itself wasn't particularly unusual, but you noticed the bulletin board at the back of the room, filled with motivational phrases, signed 'February 2019.'\nAfterward, the homeroom teacher, Mr. Li, entered the classroom. He called on you to introduce yourself to the class. Absent-mindedly, you stood up and said, 'I’m Fuqing Huang, please take care of me,' then sat back down. Your perfunctory introduction likely made you come off as distant, but you had no intention of changing that. After all, you didn’t transfer schools just to study well.\nThe day passed quickly, and when you returned home, you sat alone in your room, thinking about all you had investigated recently. Everything seemed to lead to a dead end. After all, someone had disappeared, not just physically but from everyone’s memory. Something that bizarre couldn’t simply be explained by murder. You had already checked Truth High School’s student records, and her name was nowhere to be found. There was no trace of Wenling Jiang in the second-year records, and this had been confirmed by Mr. Li, the homeroom teacher. But this didn’t mean she hadn’t attended Truth High School. It was possible that everyone had just forgotten her.\nAround six in the evening, you heard your mother calling you downstairs for dinner. You responded and went down. It was already dark outside. Your father was often abroad, so only you and your mother lived in the house. During dinner, you suddenly asked your mother, 'Mom, do you still remember Wenling?' \nWithout changing her expression, your mother replied, 'Why are you asking that again? You never had a friend named Wenling Jiang. What's wrong with you?' Her answer was the same as when you had asked her before, leaving you feeling powerless.\nAfter dinner, you volunteered to wash the dishes. Your mother mentioned that the cooking oil and seasonings were running low and that she needed to go to the supermarket. After washing the dishes, you wiped your hands and were about to head upstairs when something caught your eye. Hanging next to the fridge was a simple notepad. You remembered that your mother used it to write down what groceries she needed to buy each day. She usually asked you the night before what you wanted to eat the next day and then jotted it down on the notepad.\nCurious, you flipped through the notepad. It contained entries like, 'X month X day, A Qing wants roast meat with special sauce and caramelized bananas... X month X day, A Qing wants sweet and sour pork... X month X day, A Qing wants cola chicken wings...' However, something odd stood out—the notepad had many pages torn out, about a third of it. The missing pages seemed to be from 2018.\nWhen you reached the first remaining page, it read, 'December 3rd, A Qing wants shrimp and scrambled eggs with tomatoes.' Strangely, there was more writing after that sentence, but it had been scribbled out with a pen.\nWhile you were thinking about this, you suddenly felt a gaze on you from outside the window. You turned your head, and in the darkness outside, you saw a face staring at you through the kitchen window. The expression on the face was strange, with wide-open eyes, and it was your mother’s face! You were so startled that you shuddered, dropping the notepad onto the floor. When you picked it up, your mother’s face outside the window had vanished.\nYour heart pounded. You couldn’t understand—wasn’t your mother at the supermarket? Why was she outside the window? Was she watching you?\nJust then, the door opened, and your mother entered, holding shopping bags and smiling. 'A Qing, look, I bought your favorite snacks. I saw them at the supermarket and decided to pick some up for you.' You kept a straight face and tore out the first page of the notepad, hiding it in your pocket.\nYou forced a smile and thanked her. Your mother handed you the snack bags and shooed you out of the kitchen. Feeling dazed, you carried the bags back to your room. As you rummaged through the snacks, a receipt fell out. You picked it up, and what you saw made your spine tingle. The receipt was dated... yesterday! These snacks weren’t bought today; they were bought yesterday! Which means your mother hadn’t gone to the supermarket today! So, what about the eerie face outside the window...\nYou reached for the torn notepad page in your pocket but found that it was gone. No matter how hard you searched, it was nowhere to be found. (Your memory begins to distort, Memory Fragment 1: keyword 'notepad.')\nYou collapsed onto your bed, still in your clothes. Your mother’s strange behavior was beyond your comprehension, and you felt a deep sense of fear. This fear haunted you late into the night, until you eventually drifted into a restless sleep.",

            "Story": "Your name is Xuanxuan Li, and you are 18 years old. You are a student in Class 3, Grade 2 of Truth High School. Your academic performance is average, and getting into a prestigious school like Truth High School was quite difficult for you. This was mainly thanks to your father, who is a teacher at Truth High School and also the homeroom teacher of Class 3, Grade 2. You come from a single-parent family, as your mother passed away when you were very young. It was your father who raised you single-handedly. Due to your background, your classmates were somewhat cold toward you when you were younger since you were a child without a mother. Now that you’ve entered high school, you’ve tried hard to hide the fact that you come from a single-parent family, but somehow, your classmates found out. While they don’t openly mock you, possibly out of respect for your father, you can still sense the judgment in their eyes.\nYour father once considered finding a stepmother for you. There was an Aunt Chen who got along very well with your father and almost became your stepmother. However, Aunt Chen tragically died in a car accident while picking you up from school, so your father remains single.\nIn middle school, you had a male friend named Qingfeng Yao. He often talked about ghosts and gods, which led to him being mocked by other classmates. In this way, your situations were quite similar, and the two of you naturally became close. You were both outcasts in the class and supported each other.\nThis lasted until the third year of middle school, when Qingfeng Yao suddenly began to distance himself from you for some reason, and the two of you lost contact. After graduating from middle school, you were admitted to Truth High School, where your father works. After your first year, you entered Class 3, Grade 2, where you were surprised to find that Qingfeng Yao was also a student in the same class. However, he didn’t seem interested in rekindling your friendship, and you didn’t want to appear too eager either.\nIn your second year, you made new friends, including Siqi Lv and Yuqing Xie, with whom you became closest. Yuqing Xie is your best friend. She never judged you for coming from a single-parent family, something you deeply appreciate. The two of you even took best friend photos together and became so close that you shared everything with each other. You even bought matching four-leaf clover rings to wear as a symbol of your friendship. However, you lost your four-leaf clover ring at the end of last semester, and it made you feel sad for a long time. You don’t plan to tell Yuqing Xie about losing the ring, as you don’t want her to worry. Siqi Lv, although friendly with you, doesn’t feel as close as Yuqing Xie. You have a strange feeling that Siqi Lv’s warmth and closeness toward you seem to have some hidden motive.\nThe secret you want to hide\nYou actually have a severe father complex. Your mother passed away when you were very young, and your father is your entire world. You’ve grown deeply attached to him, believing that no man in the world is better than him. You often can’t control yourself from showing these feelings. Once, during a lunch break at school, you even secretly kissed your father while he was asleep. You despise any woman who tries to get close to your father. Anyone who tries to share your father’s love is your enemy. The car accident that claimed Aunt Chen’s life wasn’t an accident—it was your doing. Using methods you found online, you tampered with her car’s braking system, then called her to pick you up from school, making the accident appear natural. In the end, your father’s love remains yours alone, and no one will ever take it away.",
            "Script": "February 26th. Since your father is a teacher at Truth High School, you always go to school together. Today is the second Monday of the second semester for Grade 2, and when you arrive at the classroom, you notice that Yuqing Xie is already there, sitting at her desk. She always arrives at school early, and with such a diligent attitude, it's no wonder her grades are always better than yours.\nApart from Yuqing Xie, Mu Bai and Qingfeng Yao have also arrived early. Mu Bai is a quiet boy who doesn’t speak much, and his grades are average—perhaps his only merit is his good looks. Qingfeng Yao is sitting at his desk, quietly gazing at a piece of vibrant green jade in his hand. He’s had this jade hanging around his neck since middle school, but you’re unsure if it holds any special meaning for him.\nYou find your seat and sit down. Since there are only 16 students in Class 3, Grade 2, including yourself, the room feels somewhat empty. That’s when you notice a strange new boy in class. His skin is fair, and his face is delicate—he's so handsome that even celebrities would pale in comparison.\nBefore long, your homeroom teacher, Mr. Li, who is also your father, enters the classroom. After signaling for silence, he announces that there is a new transfer student this semester and asks him to introduce himself. The unfamiliar boy stands up and says, 'I’m Fuqing Huang, please take care of me.' His introduction is brief, but due to his striking appearance, almost every student remembers his name.\nAfter class, you run to your father’s office to ask him about the transfer student. Your father tells you that he doesn’t know much about him either, only that the student came from another prestigious school, one that ranks even higher than Truth High School in terms of teaching quality and admission rates. This has puzzled all the teachers—why would such a student transfer to Truth High School, and why specifically request to join Class 3, Grade 2? This piques your curiosity about Fuqing Huang, as new and mysterious things always intrigue young people.\nAt lunchtime, you sit with Yuqing Xie, and since you hadn’t seen each other over the winter break, you have plenty to talk about. During your conversation, the topic of the transfer student, Fuqing Huang, comes up. You relay everything your father told you, and like most girls, you find yourselves getting excited when talking about boys.\nAfter school, since your father is staying late to tutor some students, you head home alone. After dinner, you browse the internet, but then notice a framed photo sitting next to the computer. Oddly, from this angle, the photo gives you a strange sense of unease, though you can't quite figure out why. The more you stare at it, the stronger the feeling becomes. Frustrated, you tuck the photo away in a drawer and try not to think about it anymore. Finally, as you focus on the computer, the uneasy feeling fades (your memory begins to distort, Memory Fragment 1: keyword 'photo').\nIt's almost 10 o’clock when you finish your bath and go to bed. Being a high school student, your father doesn’t mind you spending some time on the computer, but staying up late is strictly forbidden.\nYou’re not sure how long you’ve been asleep when your phone suddenly rings. Groggily, you get up, check the time—it’s exactly midnight—and see the caller ID: 'Yuqing Xie.' How strange. Why is she calling at this hour? You answer the phone, still half-asleep. 'Yuqing? Why are you calling so late? What’s going on?'\nOn the other end, Yuqing Xie’s anxious voice comes through: 'Xuanxuan, you just said you were at school and asked me to call the police!' You’re completely baffled. What is she talking about? You reply, 'No, I’ve been sleeping. I’m at home right now, and I didn’t call you.'\nThere’s a brief pause on the other end before she responds, 'That’s impossible, you clearly just...,' but she cuts herself off, seeming to realize something. Judging from her tone, it doesn’t sound like she’s playing a prank on you. You yawn and reply, 'Yuqing, did you have a nightmare? Maybe the start of school is stressing you out. Get some rest, okay? I’m going to hang up now. Bye.' You hang up, not wanting a midnight phone call to ruin your energy for tomorrow’s classes.\nThinking this, you close your eyes and fall back asleep. After an unknown amount of time, you suddenly feel a deep chill, followed by an inexplicable sense of unease. You try to open your eyes, but they won’t budge, and your body feels paralyzed, as if you’re experiencing sleep paralysis. Your thoughts become muddled, and before long, you drift back into unconsciousness.\n(Dream Sequence)\n'Where am I?' That’s what you want to say, but oddly, no sound comes out. Everything around you is pitch black, and the only thing you can make out is what seems to be a school corridor. You want to reach out and touch the wall, but you realize you can’t move at all—not even your head. It’s as if you’re trapped inside someone else’s body, seeing everything through their eyes but unable to control it. Then, the body starts moving on its own. It seems to be hiding in a corner, using its left hand to support itself against the wall—a hand wearing a four-leaf clover ring.\nSuddenly, you notice someone in the distance, a figure you recognize immediately—it’s your father, Mr. Li. How strange. What’s he doing here so late? He glances around, and the body you’re trapped in shrinks back, avoiding his gaze. Then your father heads up the stairwell, seemingly heading to the rooftop. The body you’re in shows no intention of following him.\nNot long after, another figure appears, someone unfamiliar. You’re sure you’ve never seen this person before. They too head toward the rooftop, and now, the body you’re in starts to follow them.\nWhen you reach the top of the stairs, the body hides in the shadows of the stairwell instead of stepping onto the rooftop. The view shifts as the body moves closer to the gap in the iron door, peering through it like a voyeur. Through the gap, you see your father and the mysterious figure arguing. Their faces are contorted with anger, but oddly, there’s no sound, as if you’re watching an old silent film. Despite their intense confrontation, not a single word reaches your ears.\nThe argument seems to come to an end. Your father, with a twisted expression, shouts something at the figure before storming toward the door. The body you’re in immediately stops peeking and retreats into the dark corner. The iron door opens, and you see your father, looking angrier than you’ve ever seen him. He doesn’t notice you as he marches down the stairs.\nThe whole situation leaves you confused. Your view shifts again as the body pushes open the iron door and steps onto the rooftop. The mysterious figure is now standing on the edge of the roof, staring into the distance, their back to you. Step by step, the body approaches the figure. Then, a pair of hands appear in your view—the left one wearing the four-leaf clover ring. It’s your own hands!\nCould it be... Just as the body reaches the figure, the figure turns around, and the sight before you sends chills down your spine! The figure’s face is a void—completely black, with no eyes, no mouth, like a swirling black vortex. But somehow, in that moment, you can sense the figure’s emotions—bewilderment, confusion, panic, fear...\nThen, the hands wearing the four-leaf clover ring push the faceless figure off the roof!!! As the figure falls, they grab the hand with the ring, but in the end, they are mercilessly shaken off. In your view, the faceless figure plummets to the ground below.\nA thick fog begins to spread.\nNote: No matter what, do not reveal that you pushed someone off the roof in your dream. A pair of vengeful eyes are always watching you.",

            "Story": "Your name is Siqi Lv, and you are 18 years old, a student in Class 3, Grade 2 of Truth High School. You are gentle and quiet, and well-liked by your classmates. Last semester, you were the class representative of Class 3, and with your excellent grades and good looks, many boys admired you. Although you weren’t the most beautiful girl in the class, you were the most approachable, which made both boys and girls feel comfortable around you, including your homeroom teacher’s daughter, Xuanxuan Li.\nThe secret you want to hide\nAlright, everything described above is just a facade. While it's true that you have good grades, they don’t reflect your real abilities. Back in Grade 1, your grades were just average, and you barely got into Truth High School. However, in Grade 2, your academic performance suddenly improved, and you even became the class representative. The real reason behind this was your homeroom teacher, Mr. Li. One day, Mr. Li kept you back in the office under the pretense of tutoring. During the session, he made inappropriate advances toward you. At 18, you fully understood what was happening, but instead of resisting, you felt proud because your beauty could even seduce a teacher. Afterward, you regularly stayed behind at school for Mr. Li’s 'tutoring' sessions. Naturally, there were rewards. In exchange, you became the class representative. If it weren’t for Lengxing Ye’s exceptional grades, you might even have become the class monitor. Furthermore, Mr. Li secretly 'helped' you with your grades, ensuring you always scored high. The scholarship money at Truth High School is substantial, and for a family with average financial standing like yours, it’s quite a considerable sum. The benefits Mr. Li brought you made you eager to continue this relationship. The reason you befriended Xuanxuan Li was, of course, to stay in Mr. Li’s good graces. However, one day, you found out you were pregnant, and you were terrified. You didn’t tell Mr. Li, nor did you tell your parents. Instead, you secretly went to a private clinic to get an abortion. You still remember the doctor saying, 'It was a pair of twins, what a pity!' This left you feeling depressed for a while, but you eventually moved on. After all, you're still young, and life goes on. Of course, you must keep all of this hidden, or not only will you be ruined, but you’ll also be expelled from school. Aside from life itself, reputation is the most important thing.",
            "Script": "(Dream Sequence)\n'Where am I?' That’s what you want to say, but strangely, you can’t make a sound. Everything around you is pitch black, and the only thing you can make out is the gate of Truth High School. You try to move, but you find you’re unable to, not even to turn your head. It’s as if you’re a soul trapped in someone else’s body, seeing everything through their eyes but unable to control their actions. Your gaze is fixed on the gate, and soon, you start walking toward it. As you approach the gate, it begins to slowly open. You see a figure dressed in a security guard’s uniform waving at you, seemingly greeting you, but you can’t hear anything. Your view shifts up and down, as if nodding in response. After entering the school, you head toward the classroom building, passing through the playground. The body seems to be walking toward the dormitory. At that moment, you see someone coming toward you—it's Mr. Li. His face is filled with fear, and when he sees you, he looks even more terrified. He lowers his head and quickly walks past. You feel confused, and as you look toward the classroom building, you notice someone standing at the entrance—it’s your classmate, Mu Bai. You see something in his hand glinting in the light, but you can’t tell what it is. Slowly, a thick fog begins to spread.\nFebruary 26th, today is the second Monday of the second semester for Grade 2 at Truth High School. You woke up early, got ready, and headed to school. When you arrived at the classroom, many students were already there. You glanced around the spacious classroom, which has 40 desks, but only 16 students, including yourself. Half the classroom is empty. Then, you noticed an unfamiliar face. Last semester, there were only 15 students. The new student had fair skin and delicate features, looking more handsome than any celebrity. You’re sure you hadn’t seen him last semester. Just then, Mr. Li entered the classroom, signaling everyone to quiet down before announcing that there was a new transfer student. He asked the new student to introduce himself. The boy stood up and said, 'I’m Fuqing Huang, please take care of me,' and sat back down. His introduction was short, but due to his stunning appearance, almost everyone remembered his name. The day passed quickly, and as usual, you stayed behind for Mr. Li's 'tutoring' session. Perhaps because of the long winter break, Mr. Li asked you to stay for 'tutoring' almost every day since the semester started. After all the students left, you went to Mr. Li’s office. When you entered, the room was empty, as Mr. Li was likely still assigning homework to other classes—he didn’t only teach Class 3, Grade 2. You walked over to his desk and started looking through some papers. You opened the first drawer, finding only miscellaneous items. (Your memory begins to distort, Memory Fragment 1: keyword 'drawer.') You opened the second drawer and found many greeting cards with bold red text saying, 'Happy New Year to all students!' You recognized these as the holiday cards teachers sent to students during winter break. On New Year's Day, you received one too, printed with 'Happy New Year, Siqi Lv!' You had tossed it aside at home. Just then, the office door opened, and Mr. Li walked in. He looked a bit surprised to see you going through the greeting cards. You suddenly asked, 'Why do you have so many unsent greeting cards in your drawer?' Mr. Li scratched his head and replied, 'I’m not sure. The school distributed the cards based on the number of students in each class. We had 15 students last semester, and I thought I sent a card to each of them, but somehow, I still have 20 left. Maybe the school made a mistake and gave me extra cards.' You picked up one of the cards and felt puzzled. Each card was supposed to have a student’s name printed on it, but these 20 cards were blank where the name should be, simply saying, 'Happy New Year, student.' Could this be a printing error? Mr. Li, no longer the strict and serious teacher he was in class, locked the door behind him with a lewd grin. He was eager to start the 'tutoring' session. You had grown used to his disgusting behavior and silently endured it.",

            "Story": "Your name is Yuqing Xie, and you are 18 years old, the daughter of the chairman of the G Group in this city. You are very beautiful and are considered one of the school’s most attractive students, even at Truth High School, a prestigious institution. You performed exceptionally well on your entrance exams, which earned you a spot at Truth High School. Although it is a private school, Truth High School has one of the highest college admission rates and best teaching quality in the city, meaning that getting in almost guarantees a place at a top university. After spending a year at Truth High School, you were promoted to Class 3, Grade 2, where your grades ranked third in the class. With your beauty and high grades, you are quite popular. You are especially close to Xuanxuan Li, Lengxing Ye, and Mu Bai. The one you are closest with, however, is Xuanxuan Li. You and Xuanxuan frequently hang out together, and your friendship has grown so deep that you share everything with each other. To symbolize your friendship, you both bought matching four-leaf clover rings and wore them on your middle fingers—a pure and sweet expression of friendship. But you’ve noticed that Xuanxuan has stopped wearing her ring, which made you a little upset. Xuanxuan comes from a single-parent family. Her father, Mr. Li, is also the homeroom teacher of Class 3. You’ve heard from Xuanxuan that her mother passed away when she was very young, and although Mr. Li tried to remarry, the woman he was seeing died in a car accident. Now, it’s just Xuanxuan and her father. Many of your classmates look down on Xuanxuan because she doesn’t have a mother, but you don’t care about that and remain her best friend.\nThe secret you want to hide\nIn truth, you have a deeply nasty personality. From a young age, you have always believed you are superior to others. As the daughter of the G Group chairman, how could those commoners ever compare to you? You have always shown a facade of being well-behaved, smart, and sociable, and as a result, you easily became friends with all the girls around you. However, behind their backs, you’ve secretly spread rumors and caused them to be hated by everyone. Some even became depressed as a result. As their only 'friend,' they clung to you like you were their only lifeline, which gave you a sense of satisfaction in destroying others at will. The reason you get along so well with Xuanxuan Li is because her father is your homeroom teacher, and by being close to Xuanxuan, you could earn favor with Mr. Li and get higher grades in his evaluations. But deep down, you look down on Xuanxuan. The fact that the entire class knows she doesn't have a mother is your doing. You secretly spread the news she desperately tried to hide, isolating her from her classmates so that you could be her only friend. The truth is, you harbor the most malice toward Xuanxuan. Someone as pathetic as her, without a mother, should be honored to be your friend. In reality, Xuanxuan doesn’t have many friends in the class, and aside from you, her only other female friend is Siqi Lv. However, you believe Siqi is only befriending Xuanxuan because of Mr. Li, so they’re not true friends. Deep down, Xuanxuan is still a lonely and pitiful girl. You’re particularly bothered by the fact that Xuanxuan stopped wearing the four-leaf clover ring. You fear she may have found out something and no longer wants to wear the symbol of your friendship.",
            "Script": "February 26th, today is the second Monday of the second semester at Truth High School. You arrived at school early, found your seat, and took out all the books you needed for today’s classes. You noticed that two of your classmates were already there: Mu Bai, your good friend, and Qingfeng Yao, the infamous troublemaker of the class. Qingfeng Yao is known for bullying weaker students, performing poorly in school, and generally having a bad reputation. He was sitting quietly at his desk, staring at a piece of jade in his hand. Before long, other students arrived. Once everyone was seated, you did a quick headcount. Wait, there’s one more person! Class 3, Grade 2 should have 16 students this semester, but you noticed a strange new boy. His skin was pale, and his features delicate—he was incredibly handsome, more so than any celebrity. You couldn’t help but stare at him. You were sure you hadn’t seen him last semester. Just then, Mr. Li, the homeroom teacher, entered the classroom and signaled for silence. He announced that there was a new transfer student this semester and asked him to introduce himself. The boy stood up and said, 'I’m Fuqing Huang, please take care of me,' and sat back down. His introduction was brief, but his stunning appearance left a lasting impression on everyone.\nThe morning classes went by quickly. Since the semester had just started, there wasn’t much homework. During class, the transfer student rarely spoke, only answering questions when the teacher called on him by name. For some reason, you felt a slight sense of unease from him, which piqued your interest. At lunch, you and Xuanxuan Li sat together. Since you hadn’t seen each other during winter break, you had plenty to talk about. Naturally, the topic of conversation eventually turned to the mysterious transfer student, Fuqing Huang. Xuanxuan told you that her father, Mr. Li, mentioned a strange student who applied to transfer into the school over winter break and specifically requested to join Class 3, Grade 2. The school agreed, though Xuanxuan didn’t know all the details. This made you even more curious about Fuqing Huang. However, this curiosity wasn’t driven by any romantic feelings; it was purely a fascination with the unknown. Even though you were intrigued, you didn’t feel the need to approach him right away. After all, there was still a whole semester ahead, and plenty of time to get to know him. In the afternoon, classes resumed. Since the semester had just started, most of the lessons were reviews of last term’s material, which was quite boring for someone like you who had mastered the content. You found yourself daydreaming. You opened your bag, where you kept all your books, but there was a hidden compartment where you stashed your romance novels, which you often read during self-study sessions. You pulled out a popular novel and became engrossed in it. (Your memory begins to distort, Memory Fragment 1: keyword 'school bag.') The day passed quickly, and after finishing your homework and watching some TV, you went to bed early.\nAt 11:59 PM, you were sound asleep when your phone suddenly rang. Groggily, you checked the caller ID: it was Xuanxuan Li. You were puzzled—why was she calling so late? What could be so urgent that it couldn’t wait until tomorrow at school? You answered the phone, and before you could say anything, you heard Xuanxuan’s panicked voice: 'Yuqing… Thank goodness! You’re safe! Help me, please! Call the police, I’m at school… I can’t get through to the police!' Her voice was shaky, and it sounded like something was interfering with the call. Then, the line went dead. Her terrified tone shook you awake immediately. You tried calling her back, but the automated message said, 'Sorry, the number you are trying to reach is unavailable. Please try again later.' It felt like a bucket of cold water had been dumped on you—you were chilled to the bone. Without thinking, you quickly got dressed and opened the door, dialing Xuanxuan’s number again while silently praying for her. The call connected. 'Hello? Yuqing? Why are you calling so late? What’s going on?' Xuanxuan’s voice was groggy, as if she had just woken up. 'Xuanxuan! You just called me and said you were at school! You asked me to call the police!' you exclaimed. On the other end, Xuanxuan sounded confused: 'No, I’ve been sleeping. I’m at home right now, and I didn’t call you.' Stunned, you checked your phone’s call log—there was no record of Xuanxuan’s call. 'How is that possible? You just…' You trailed off, unable to finish your sentence. Xuanxuan, still sounding puzzled, said, 'Yuqing, you must have had a nightmare. It’s the stress of starting school again. Get some rest, okay? I’m going back to sleep. Bye.' With that, she hung up. Shaken, you tried to calm yourself down, but no matter how many times you checked, there was no call from Xuanxuan in your phone’s call history. You began to doubt yourself—had it all been a bad dream? The fear in her voice had felt so real, though, as did the sense of dread that came from the depths of your soul. Still uneasy, you slowly drifted back to sleep.\n(Dream Sequence)\n'Where am I?' You wanted to speak, but no sound came out. The darkness surrounded you, and you could just make out what seemed to be the school’s hallway. You tried to reach out and touch the walls, but your body wouldn’t move. It was as if you were a soul trapped inside someone else’s body, seeing everything through their eyes but unable to control them. In this state, it seemed that you had only your vision—no hearing or touch. You could only passively receive information, unable to react to it. The hallway and staircase were pitch black, and your body was hidden in the shadows. The person whose body you were in seemed fixated on the stairwell. You recognized the stairs; they led from the sixth floor to the rooftop of the school. You noticed a hand resting against the wall beside you—it was your hand, and on your finger was the four-leaf clover ring. Did the person whose body you were in have the same ring as you? Just as you were wondering this, your view shifted, and the body crouched down. Your gaze followed. Suddenly, someone stormed down from the rooftop, visibly angry. You squinted and realized it was Mr. Li, your homeroom teacher. What was Mr. Li doing on the rooftop so late at night? About a minute later, your view started shaking as if something had startled the body, but there was no movement. The body remained in hiding, and you saw someone else running down from the rooftop—it was your best friend, Xuanxuan Li. Three minutes later, yet another person descended from the rooftop—Lengxing Ye, the class monitor. You were completely bewildered. Why were these three people on the rooftop so late at night? After Lengxing Ye left, the body still didn’t move, remaining hidden while keeping its gaze fixed on the stairwell leading to the rooftop… All around you, a thick fog began to rise.",

            "Story": "Your name is Qingfeng Yao, and you are 18 years old, a student in Class 3, Grade 2 of Truth High School. You perform poorly academically, and the only reason you were able to enroll in such a prestigious school is because of your family's influence. After all, simply graduating from Truth High guarantees a place at university, and your family has high hopes for you. However, you don’t share their enthusiasm. Since childhood, you’ve lived a life of luxury and have never had to worry about your future. School is nothing more than a way to kill time for you. Your family arranged for you to stay in the school dormitory to ensure that you would focus on your studies, which only irritates you further.\nThe secret you want to hide\nYou are actually the heir of a Feng Shui master family. Your grandfather is a well-known Feng Shui master who built a fortune by helping people with Feng Shui and fortune-telling. However, you have always disliked your grandfather’s practices. When you were younger, you were proud of it and would boast to your classmates, but after being reprimanded by teachers and ridiculed by classmates, you grew to detest it, seeing it as nothing more than a conman’s tricks. As a result, you never tell anyone about it now. Your grandfather once gave you a green 'spirit jade,' which he told you to wear around your neck. He said you may never need it in your lifetime, but if it ever turns red, it means danger is near, and you must run. If it turns gray, you must never return home, as it would bring disaster to your family. Yes, your grandfather is just that unreliable, and as far as you know, every important member of your family carries one of these spirit jades. In middle school, you were close to a girl named Xuanxuan Li. Since she was raised by her single father, many classmates looked down on her, and you were also mocked for boasting about your grandfather’s Feng Shui skills. The two of you bonded over this shared experience, and as time passed, you developed feelings for her. However, in your third year of middle school, Xuanxuan mentioned that her father was seeing a new woman, and she often spoke highly of how kind and gentle her potential stepmother was. One day, you overheard Xuanxuan on the phone, speaking sweetly to a woman named 'Aunt Chen,' thanking her for picking her up and telling her to drive faster. But as soon as she hung up, her smile turned sinister, and you heard her mutter, 'The faster you drive, the faster you’ll die.' The next day, the news reported a car accident involving a woman named Chen, who had died horribly in a crash caused by brake failure. Although you didn’t want to believe it, you couldn’t shake the image of Xuanxuan’s eerie smile from your mind. That night, you even dreamt of her staring at you through your window. Since then, you’ve felt a mixture of fear and affection for her, unable to reconcile your feelings. After graduating middle school, you both entered Truth High. During your first semester in Grade 2, you were shocked to find that Xuanxuan’s father, Mr. Li, was now your homeroom teacher. This left you feeling conflicted, constantly watching Xuanxuan but keeping your distance. The memory of that smile still haunts you, yet your feelings for her remain, leaving you trapped in an endless cycle of fear and affection.",
            "Script": "February 26th, today is the second Monday of the second semester for Grade 2 at Truth High. You arrived at the classroom and noticed Mu Bai was already there. He’s not a particularly good student, but at least he’s diligent. You approached him, noticing that he seemed to be staring at a four-leaf clover ring. Curious, you asked, 'Why is a guy like you holding a woman’s ring?' Startled, Mu Bai quickly shoved the ring into his bag, nervously explaining that he had just found it and was looking for the owner. You didn’t believe him—it seemed like he was hiding something. Where had you seen that ring before? That’s right, Xuanxuan Li had one just like it. Could Mu Bai be interested in her? The thought made you look at him suspiciously, but you didn’t press further. You’d have time to figure it out later. After glaring at him, you took your seat. You absentmindedly glanced at the spirit jade hanging around your neck. Its vibrant green color stood out, and you couldn’t help but think how much more valuable it was than any jade sold in stores. But you knew better than to sell it—your grandfather would break your legs if you did. Your seat was near the back of the classroom, which annoyed you. Despite there being only 15 students in Class 3, there were 40 desks, leaving the room feeling empty and making it difficult to slack off without being noticed. After everyone arrived, you noticed a new student—a pale, handsome boy, even more good-looking than a celebrity. You were certain you hadn’t seen him last semester. Just then, Mr. Li entered and introduced the boy as Fuqing Huang, a new transfer student. Fuqing gave a brief introduction, which somehow annoyed you. But at least Class 3 now had 16 students, which made the empty room feel a little more normal. The day passed quickly, but after school, you noticed something odd. Siqi Lv, one of the two most beautiful girls in Class 3, was often seen staying late after school, supposedly receiving extra tutoring from Mr. Li. You hadn’t paid much attention before, but since the start of this semester, it seemed like she stayed behind almost every day. As a teenage boy, your imagination naturally wandered to inappropriate places. Siqi Lv was so beautiful—could something be happening between her and Mr. Li? Out of curiosity, you pretended to head back to the dorm but instead hid in the bathroom, waiting to see what would happen. At 5:30 PM, you decided it was time to check the office. As you stepped out of the bathroom, you were startled to see that it was already completely dark outside, which didn’t make sense for this time of year. You shrugged it off and made your way to the office, only to find the door closed and the lights off. You pressed your ear to the door, but there was no sound inside. Had you been wrong about the 'tutoring sessions'? Deciding to head home, you passed by the classroom and were shocked to see that the door was open. That should have been impossible—after school, a teacher always locked the doors. Feeling a chill, you peeked inside. The room was pitch black, even darker than the hallway. As your eyes adjusted to the darkness, you saw a horrifying sight. Figures were sitting in all the empty seats—19 of them. You could feel their eyes on you, even though you couldn’t see their faces. Terrified, you screamed and ran back to the bathroom, the only place with light. As you passed Mr. Li’s office, you noticed that there was now a light under the door. But how? You hadn’t heard anyone go in. You continued running, hiding in the same bathroom stall, shaking and praying that 'they' wouldn’t come for you. Then, you heard footsteps… and the lights went out. You screamed in despair, certain that this was the end. Just then, you heard a man’s voice, annoyed and scolding you for hiding in the bathroom. It was the duty teacher, holding a flashlight and asking what class you were in. You were too stunned to respond and left the bathroom without a word, walking back to the dorm in a daze. You didn’t notice the teacher watching you as you left, or that dark red blood was oozing from his eyes and nose. His head fell off moments later, but the headless body simply picked it up and disappeared into the night. You barely remember how you got back to the dorm. Once there, you collapsed onto your bed without even changing your clothes.\n(Dream Sequence)\n'Where am I?' you want to say, but no sound comes out. The darkness surrounds you, and you seem to be in your dorm room. You try to move but find that you’re completely paralyzed, like a soul trapped in someone else’s body. You notice that the body’s right hand is holding a phone, and you see that the number dialed is for the police, but you can’t hear anything. The silence is eerie, and it feels like you’ve lost all senses except for sight. Your head turns, and you see the rooftop of the school in the distance. A shadowy figure stands at the edge, peering over the side before calmly walking away. Moments later, another figure appears, similarly looking down before running away in a panic. You don’t understand what any of this means. Then, your view shifts again, and you see a terrifying sight—three shadowy figures standing behind you, staring at you. They are the same figures you saw in the classroom. The thick fog begins to envelop the campus.",

            "Story": "Your name is Lengxing Ye, and you are 18 years old, the class monitor of Class 3, Grade 2 at Truth High School. You consistently rank first in the entire grade, acing nearly every exam, even the most obscure questions. Besides your academic prowess, you excel in sports and have a unique talent for art. You are the ideal student, excelling in every aspect, from intellect to physical fitness and artistic ability. Because of this, not only is your homeroom teacher, Mr. Li, extremely optimistic about your future, but even the school principal sees you as a shining star, someone who might one day leave their mark on the history of Truth High School. Despite your brilliance, your seriousness and intensity alienate most of your classmates. They respect you, but they are also somewhat afraid of you, with some even finding you scarier than the teachers. From an academic perspective, you are seen as a genius, an unbeatable scholar. However, it’s not your intention to push others away; you simply find that most of your classmates don’t think on the same level as you, and interacting with them often feels like you have to slow yourself down. It’s easier to focus on your studies in solitude. Still, you aren’t completely without friends—Yuqing Xie and Mu Bai are two of the classmates you get along with. There’s a rumor going around that you and Yuqing are dating, but it’s entirely false. Truth High is extremely strict about its rules, and dating is one of the quickest ways to get expelled.\nThe secret you want to hide\nYou and Yuqing Xie couldn’t possibly be dating because you aren’t interested in women at all. Most of the girls you know are obsessed with romance novels and Korean pop stars, which holds no appeal to you. While Yuqing isn’t like that, she has her darker side. She is friends with Xuanxuan Li, but behind her back, Yuqing spreads nasty rumors about her, including the fact that Xuanxuan doesn’t have a mother. Although you admire Yuqing’s intelligence, you certainly don’t have any romantic feelings for her. What actually interests you are the boys, like Mu Bai. He’s not particularly strong academically, but he’s very handsome—though not quite your type, you still enjoy his company. In fact, when you were in elementary school, you weren’t the top student. You were mischievous and often got into trouble, skipping class with other kids. There was a girl in your class who had a heart condition, and no one wanted to play with her out of fear that she might have a heart attack. They called her 'sick cat.' You pitied her and often played with her, despite the teasing from other kids who accused you of liking her. To prove them wrong, a group of bullies dared you to trick her into a large cardboard box in an abandoned warehouse. They sealed the box with tape but left a small hole for her to breathe. You all ran off to play and forgot about her until much later. When you returned, the box was gone. Panic set in among your group, and you all lied to the school and police, saying you hadn’t seen her. The next day, her body was found. It had been taken with a truckload of trash to a dump site. She had died from a heart attack. This memory haunted you, and to escape it, you buried yourself in your studies, turning into the academic 'monster' you are today. Even though many years have passed, you still dream about her climbing into that box, her timid face etched in your mind.",

It wasn’t that Truth High had trouble filling spots—other classes in Grade 2 had over 40 students—it was just Class 3 that was oddly small. You didn’t know why. Then, you noticed a new face—a pale, incredibly handsome boy with cold, delicate features. He looked like a celebrity, and the moment you saw him, you felt a strange attraction. You were certain he wasn’t in your class last semester. Just then, Mr. Li entered the room and introduced him as Fuqing Huang, a new transfer student. His introduction was brief, but something about him intrigued you. He seemed different from everyone else—almost like you. With Fuqing, Class 3 now had 16 students, which was still small, but at least it wasn’t as empty. The day passed quickly, and after doing your homework and having dinner, you returned to your room to read. Balancing work and rest was important to you, and after a long winter break, it was time to refocus on your studies. Around 9 PM, you decided it was time to shower and sleep, so you closed your book and put it back on the shelf. (Your memory begins to distort, Memory Fragment 1: keyword 'photo.') Just then, you received a strange text message. The sender was labeled as 'Yourself.' You had a habit of saving your own number in your phone under that name, but now you had received a message from it? Confused, you opened it. The message was long, but most of it was obscured by black lines, like strands of hair, leaving only the words 'Go to the rooftop... through the window...' visible. What was this? An elaborate prank? You quickly typed a response: 'Who are you?' and sent it. Seconds later, your phone pinged with another message from 'Yourself.' When you opened it, the message read: 'Who are you?' Your own reply had been sent back to you. But how? If the sender was using your number, that would mean they couldn’t send messages to you. Yet, somehow, this message had come through. Who was sending these messages?\n(Dream Sequence)\n'Where am I?' you want to ask, but no sound comes out. The darkness surrounds you, and though you want to move, you find yourself completely paralyzed, like a soul trapped in someone else’s body. You look up and see stars; it’s not a completely dark night. You start to adjust to the darkness and realize you are on the rooftop of the school, surrounded by solar panels and antennas. Yes, you recognize this place! For a long time, nothing happens, and you remain frozen in place, unable to control the body you’re trapped in, staring at the iron door to the rooftop. Time passes, and suddenly your vision becomes blurry, and darkness creeps in from the edges, like the person whose body you’re in is falling asleep. You lose sight of everything. Damn it, how could they fall asleep now? There’s no sound, and it seems like you’ve lost all senses except sight. It feels like half an hour passes before your eyes open again. As the vision clears, you notice someone on the rooftop, far away, leaning over the edge. You can’t make out who it is in the darkness. The figure peers down before turning and running back inside. You move closer to the edge and look down, where you see two shadows—one lying motionless on the ground and the other standing still. Before your eyes, the motionless shadow disappears, and the standing one flees toward the school gates in a panic. The body you’re in seems just as shocked as you are and rushes down from the rooftop. As you flee, a thick fog starts to envelop the area.",

            "Script": "As you were pondering whose diary it could be, the sound of hurried footsteps suddenly echoed from outside the door, unnerving you in the otherwise silent environment. Startled, you dropped the diary, but when you bent down to pick it up, it had mysteriously vanished, no matter how hard you searched. You opened the door to see what was happening outside, only to be met with darkness. The hallway was eerily empty. This sent a chill down your spine—it's only February, the sky shouldn't be dark this early, and the school should be bustling with students at this hour. Yet, there wasn't a single sound around you. The hallway was pitch black, and the stairwells were unlit, as if you were deep in a remote forest.\nYou shook your head, took a deep breath, and slowly stepped out of the office. Mr. Li’s office and Class 3 are both on the 5th floor of the teaching building. Looking out from the corridor, you noticed a thick fog had rolled in outside. Slowly, you began walking down the hall towards the stairs. The atmosphere was too strange; you needed to leave immediately. There must be a security guard somewhere on campus, and heading to the security office seemed like the safest option.\nAs you cautiously moved, a hand suddenly grabbed you from behind, covering your mouth and pulling you into an empty classroom. The door was shut quickly, and you stared in wide-eyed terror—only to realize the person covering your mouth was Mr. Li! He looked disheveled, far removed from his usual composed appearance as a teacher.\nMr. Li gestured for you to stay quiet, and you followed his gaze to the window, where you saw something that froze you in place. Outside the classroom was another Mr. Li, his face expressionless, his eyes dead.\nAfter scanning his surroundings, the figure outside eventually left, and Mr. Li beside you let out a sigh of relief. Before you could ask any questions, Mr. Li grabbed you and urgently asked, 'Have you been to the rooftop? Which Mu Bai are you? The second or third?!' His words left you utterly confused.\nSeeing the bewilderment on your face, Mr. Li seemed to give up, slumping to the floor and muttering, 'I don’t know who she is, but she killed herself! It wasn’t me! It’s not my fault!'\nAt that moment, Mr. Li’s phone, which had been tossed on the ground, lit up with an incoming call—but no ringtone. It was set to silent. Mr. Li, lost in his own ramblings, didn’t seem to notice. You picked it up, seeing the call was from his daughter. Li’s daughter? Could that be Xuanxuan Li? Maybe you could call her for help.\nYou answered the phone, and a female voice spoke, 'Hello?'\nIn a panic, you said, 'Xuanxuan? It’s Mu Bai. I’m with Mr. Li, and we’re hiding in a classroom. Something strange is happening—there’s a creature wandering the school that looks exactly like Mr. Li! Please, call the police!' You spoke in a rush, but the other end of the line remained silent.\nFinally, a voice responded, 'Found you.' The voice wasn’t just coming from the phone—it was right beside you.\nYou shuddered and looked up, and there, standing by the window, was another Mr. Li, holding a phone to his ear, smiling eerily at you. The voice was coming from him.\n(Dream Sequence)\n'Where am I?' you wanted to ask, but no sound came out. The surroundings were pitch black, and though you wanted to reach out to touch the hallway walls, you found yourself completely immobile, as if trapped in another person’s body, only able to see through their eyes without any control over the body. Soon, your vision began to shift, your gaze lifting upward, and you saw a shadowy figure falling from above. Judging by its trajectory, it must have fallen at the entrance to the school building.\nYour vision shifted again, as if you were running, descending rapidly through the dormitory stairs to the ground floor, then rushing toward the spot where the shadow had fallen. Just as you arrived, another figure hurriedly dashed through the corridor and disappeared. The figure was dressed like a teacher, but you couldn’t make out their face.\nYou reached the entrance to the building, but there was nothing there—no sign of the fallen shadow. But then, you noticed something glinting in the grass—a four-leaf clover ring.\nYour view moved forward as you reached out with your right hand and picked up the ring. Slowly, the scene around you began to fade to black.\nAt some point, fog had started to spread through the surroundings.\nWhen you woke up again, you found yourself lying in the same classroom where you had encountered Mr. Li. Looking around, you saw that both the panicked Mr. Li and the eerie Mr. Li were gone, leaving only a puddle of blood beside you. Horrified, you stared at the dark red stain. If you remembered correctly, Mr. Li had been crouching there just moments ago. Not wanting to stay in that place a second longer, you bolted from the classroom.\n(Your memory begins to distort, Memory Fragment 2: keyword 'blood.')\nAs soon as you stepped out of the classroom, you heard footsteps coming from the staircase below. Fear overwhelmed you. After seeing that pool of blood, you were like a frightened animal, and now those footsteps pushed you into full panic. You ran upstairs, recalling what Mr. Li had asked you about earlier—whether or not you’d been to the rooftop. Those words left a deep impression on you. Afraid to stay in the classroom and unwilling to head downstairs, you ran toward the rooftop, hoping for a way out. You dashed up to the 6th floor, through the darkened hallway, and burst out onto the rooftop!",

            "Script": "On the morning of February 27, you woke up with your head feeling groggy. After a quick wash, you went downstairs for breakfast. Your mother had already prepared it and was waiting for you with her usual warm smile. However, after the events of yesterday, just seeing her filled you with a sense of deep dread. You quickly ate and left the house for school.\nIt was Tuesday, your second day at Truth High School, and today you planned to begin investigating the school. Since the short breaks between classes wouldn’t give you enough time, you decided to conduct your search after school in the evening. But doing so would put you at greater risk, considering the mysteries the school concealed.\nUpon arriving at school, you walked around the grounds to familiarize yourself. Truth High School was fairly simple in layout, with five main buildings and a cafeteria: the Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 buildings, the administrative building, and the dormitories. Each building had six floors, but they were quite large, and their expansive footprint could easily match that of a typical 16-floor building. Besides these, there were smaller buildings like the theater and warehouses.\nBy the time you entered the classroom, the first lesson of the day was about to start. Something struck you as odd—there were fewer students than before. You counted only 13 people, including yourself. This was strange, as you distinctly remembered 21 students yesterday. Could eight students have called in sick all at once?\nThe bell rang, and Mr. Li entered the room, starting his lesson as if he hadn’t noticed that eight students were missing. After class, you went to Mr. Li’s office and asked him why so many students were absent. Mr. Li gave you a puzzled look and replied, 'Only three students—Mu Bai, Siqi Lv, and Qingfeng Yao—are missing today. I tried calling them, but no one picked up. But it’s just the three of them—everyone else, including you, is here. Our class only has 16 students in total.' His response sent a chill down your spine.\nIt had begun. That 'thing' which made her disappear was at work again. Aside from the possible legitimate absences of Mu Bai, Siqi Lv, and Qingfeng Yao, five other students had vanished from memory, just like her. No one except you remembered them. It was as though they had never existed! What was happening? And it wasn’t a coincidence that the other three hadn’t shown up either. If you could find them, maybe you could uncover the truth.\nWithout noticing your troubled expression, Mr. Li continued, 'Fuqing Huang, even though you had good grades at your previous school, the pace of learning here is different. Stay after school, and I’ll give you some extra help in my office.' This seemed like a perfect excuse to stay at school longer, so you agreed. As you left his office, you felt a vague sense of unease about Mr. Li, though you couldn’t pinpoint exactly why.\nShortly after exiting the office, everything suddenly went black. When you woke up, you found yourself in complete darkness. As your eyes adjusted, you realized you were in a classroom. Through the window, the outside world was eerily devoid of light, and the atmosphere felt oppressive. What was happening? It had been daytime just moments ago—could you have been unconscious for that long? Feeling your way around, you turned on the classroom lights. The sudden brightness was harsh, but you were relieved. Anything was better than being left in the dark.\nNow able to observe your surroundings, you realized that this was Class 3’s classroom. But something was off. Though it looked similar to the classroom you had attended during the day, there were subtle differences. On the back wall, the class bulletin board was covered in drawings and messages, and at the bottom, the date read 'December 2018.'\nAs you moved further into the room, you noticed something under one of the desks. Bending down to pick it up, you discovered it was a voice recorder. You pressed the play button, but there was no response—it seemed broken. (Your memory starts to distort, Memory Fragment 2: keyword 'Recording.')\nYou cautiously left the classroom, only to find the hallway shrouded in darkness. Every corridor and staircase was cloaked in black. The cold crept into your bones—this was no place to linger. Class 3 was on the 5th floor, so you hurried down the stairs toward the ground floor. Soon, you reached the first floor and stepped out onto the empty schoolyard. The playground, usually bustling with life during the day, was completely deserted now. Only the flagpole stood tall, illuminated by the eerie moonlight. And to your horror, a thin layer of mist began to roll across the field, growing thicker by the second.\nSomething was wrong. Where had this fog come from? It had appeared far too suddenly, almost as if it was trying to trap you. Without hesitation, you sprinted toward the school’s main gate, where the security office was located, hoping you could find help there.\nAs the mist thickened, you ran faster. Luckily, you were athletic and reached the security office before the visibility dropped below five meters. The lights were still on inside, so you pounded on the door urgently. From inside, an annoyed voice shouted, 'I’m coming! Stop banging on the door!' A middle-aged security guard opened the door with a scowl.\nYou quickly rushed into the room, catching your breath. The guard, startled by your frantic appearance, asked, 'Which class are you from? It’s almost midnight—why are you still at school?' You froze. Midnight? Glancing at the clock on the wall, you saw the date displayed: December 2, 2018, 11:27 PM. Before you could process this, a piercing scream echoed from the direction of the school building.\nThe guard’s face turned pale, and he demanded, 'What’s going on? Is there anyone else still in the building?' You explained that you had been left behind by Mr. Li and that something strange had happened—the scream might have come from Mr. Li himself. Without another word, the guard grabbed a flashlight and said, 'Come with me. The teacher on duty is making rounds—we might run into him or Mr. Li.' Together, you stepped out into the mist, which enveloped you like a living entity. The guard muttered to himself, 'Damn it, I only dozed off for an hour. Where did this fog come from?'\nFollowing the guard toward the school building, you reached the entrance just as a loud thud resounded. A body fell from above and hit the ground right in front of you. Startled, you froze, but the guard reacted quickly, rushing forward. Upon reaching the body, he realized it was Mr. Li, the teacher from Class 3. His eyes were wide open, and blood oozed from his nose, mouth, and eyes.\nBoth of you were paralyzed with fear. After a tense moment, the guard bent down to check for signs of life. His face went white as he whispered, 'He’s dead. Call the police—he must have fallen from the roof.' Trembling, you pulled out your phone, but no matter how many times you dialed, the line was dead. The guard’s phone was equally useless, and even emergency numbers were unreachable.\nLooking at Mr. Li’s lifeless body sent a chill through you. Just then, Mr. Li’s body began to twitch, slowly rising from the ground in an unnatural, twisted motion. Paralyzed with fear, you and the guard watched in horror as Mr. Li’s body morphed into the shape of a giant woman, standing nearly four meters tall. Her long hair hung loosely over her blood-soaked face, which had split open into a gaping mouth two meters wide.\nSuddenly, another person dashed out from the shadows, grabbing you by the arm and pulling you away. The massive woman lunged at the guard, who screamed as she tore his head off in a spray of blood. In a daze, you followed your rescuer, running toward the stairs as fast as you could.\nIt was only then that you realized—the person pulling you along looked exactly like you! Panicked, you stopped dead in your tracks and grabbed onto the stair railing, shouting, 'Who are you? Why do you look like me?!' The other you looked back in frustration, urging you to keep moving. 'There’s no time! We’ll die if we stay here—keep running, and I’ll explain!'\nThough you hesitated for a moment, you eventually forced yourself to follow. The other you led the way, explaining between breaths, 'I’m the first, you’re the second, and there’s one more after us. We need to get to the rooftop—that’s the only way out!' You barely had time to process his words before you reached the 6th floor.\nThe moment you stepped onto the 6th floor, you saw the massive woman’s head protruding through the rooftop entrance. Her eyes were filled with hatred, and her bloody mouth gaped wide open. In an instant, the other you pushed you forward, screaming, 'Run to the rooftop!' Before you could react, the giant mouth closed around him, tearing off his head and upper body in one swift motion.\nIn that moment, everything seemed to slow down. Strangely calm, you turned and sprinted toward the rooftop stairs, leaving the darkness behind as you rushed toward the only escape.",

            "Script": "This day, you woke up early, your head aching as if you had endured a night of nightmares. After getting up and brushing your teeth, you noticed your father wasn’t having breakfast in the dining room. You assumed he had left early for school to deal with some preparations. As you continued eating breakfast, you washed your hands and dried them with a paper towel before preparing to head out. But a quick glance at the trash can caught your attention—a crumpled piece of paper with pen markings. Curious, you fished it out. This must be something your father discarded.\nYou unfolded it and found it was just a piece torn from a notebook. There was nothing significant written on it, so you tossed it back. (Your memory begins to distort, Memory Fragment 2: keyword 'paper.')\nStill a bit unsettled, you arrived at school, where only 13 students were present. Siqi Lv, Mu Bai, and Qingfeng Yao seemed to be absent—strange, had they taken the day off? Before you could dwell on it, the bell rang, and your father, Mr. Li, entered the classroom to begin teaching.\nAfter class, Yuqing Xie came over, and you two chatted about your shared interests. You noticed she was still wearing the four-leaf clover ring that symbolized your friendship, which made you happy. Even after a long winter break, your bond remained strong.\nThe day passed quickly, and you planned to ask your father about the paper in the trash once you got home. But as the school day ended and everyone left, your father was still nowhere to be found. Just as you were about to head to his office to look for him, your phone rang—it was your father. His voice came through the phone, sounding eerie and disjointed: 'Xuanxuan… I… meeting… late… Stay… Class 3… Don’t leave…' The cold tone of his voice unnerved you, but since he asked you to stay, you decided to wait in the classroom.\n'Knock, knock.' What was that sound? You heard a strange noise, like someone tapping on a door or glass. 'Knock, knock.' The sound persisted, so you followed it to the front of the classroom. The closer you got to the source, the clearer it became. 'Knock, knock.' It was coming from the blackboard. As you pressed your ear to the blackboard, trying to figure out what was making the noise, two pale hands suddenly burst out from the board and pulled you inside.\nTime passed. You awoke, dazed, finding yourself under the podium. Crawling out, you realized it was completely dark outside. But before the hands grabbed you, it had only been dusk. How long had you been unconscious? You checked your phone—it was 5:25 PM, the same time you’d been attacked. To confirm your suspicion, you waited a few minutes, but the phone still displayed 5:25 PM. Time had stopped.\nLooking around, you noticed the motivational posters on the classroom bulletin board. But something was off—the board now had messages from December 2018, though it didn’t specify the exact day. A chill ran down your spine as you realized things were moving in an unexpected, terrifying direction.\nYour gaze returned to the blackboard, where those pale hands had grabbed you. Fear surged through you as you dialed your father’s number. 'Beep… beep… beep…' After a few rings, a cold, automated voice responded: 'The number you dialed is not available. Please try again later.' How could that be? Your father always kept his phone on him. Worry gnawed at you.\nAs you paced, your foot hit something. Looking down, you saw four large cardboard boxes. You didn’t recall seeing these in the classroom before. The boxes were stuffed full, nearly overflowing. Curious, you pressed on one—it felt soft. Unable to resist, you opened one of the boxes. Immediately, you regretted it. Inside were chunks of meat, neatly arranged without a single drop of blood. But what froze your heart in terror was one piece in particular—a hand, its middle finger adorned with a four-leaf clover ring. It was Yuqing Xie’s ring! Horrified, you looked at the remaining three boxes, trembling. If this box contained Yuqing, what was inside the others?\n(Your memory begins to distort, Memory Fragment 3: keyword 'hand.')\nA gust of wind blew through the room, and you noticed the classroom door slowly closing. Panic gripped you—your instincts screamed that if that door shut, you might never escape. Mustering all your strength, you scrambled to the door, making it out just before it closed completely. Oddly, after you exited, the door began to reopen on its own. A sense of dread washed over you as you saw what caused it—a pale hand gripping the door handle, pulling it open. And you distinctly remembered: there had been no one behind that door.\nYou thought of the pale hands that had pulled you into the blackboard, terror overwhelming you. You backed away before sprinting down the hall. You had to leave this place! The classroom was haunted, and you needed to find your father and escape together. Outside, the world was shrouded in darkness, a thick fog enveloping the building. You couldn’t see if anyone else was around. After running for what felt like forever, you stopped, realizing you were on the 6th floor. Beyond this was the rooftop. But you hesitated—going up meant being trapped if something blocked the stairs. You ran to the other side of the corridor instead.\nHiding in the shadows, your heart pounded in your chest. You thought of that terrifying box and the four-leaf clover ring. With trembling hands, you called Yuqing Xie’s phone, praying that the ring in the box was just a coincidence and not hers.\nThe call connected, and before the person on the other end could speak, you quickly said, 'Yuqing, thank goodness! You’re okay! Please, help me! Call the police! I’m at the school, and it’s haunted. I can’t reach the emergency services!' But something was off—there was no sound from the other end. 'Yuqing? Can you hear me?'\n'Go to Class 3. Don’t go to the rooftop.' The voice on the other end was cold, female. What? Why was Yuqing telling you to go back to the classroom? You tried to argue, 'I can’t go back there! The classroom is haunted. Please, Yuqing, help me! Call the police!' But the voice only repeated: 'Go to Class 3. Don’t go to the rooftop.' Then, the line went dead.\nA chill ran through your body. Was that really Yuqing? That cold, eerie voice didn’t sound like her at all. Most unsettling of all, the voice said to 'go to the classroom.' You remembered the pale hand behind the door—it was that ghost! It must have intercepted your call and was trying to lure you back into the classroom! Tears welled up in your eyes. The familiar school had become a place far more terrifying than any funeral parlor.\nThe rooftop! That’s the only place left! Whatever that voice told you, the rooftop might be the only safe option. Wiping away your tears, you ran toward the stairs to the rooftop, charging through the dark hallway, pulling open the iron door, and bursting onto the rooftop.",

You pretended to casually glance at the message, which simply read: 'Come to the rooftop.' Mr. Li’s face grew more serious as he stared at the message, then told you, 'Wait here for a moment. I'll be right back.' He left the office, closing the door behind him.\n\nYou felt curious but didn’t dare follow him. If you were caught, you’d be in serious trouble. Left alone, you began flipping through some of the teaching materials in the office. Suddenly, you heard the rustling of paper—'shh... shh... shh...'—which startled you. You turned to the source of the sound. It was a calendar hanging on the wall, its pages flipping backwards rapidly: February 11, 2019... January 21, 2019... January 3, 2019... December 29, 2018. You looked at the window—it was closed, and the night was windless. There was no way the wind could have been flipping the pages. Wait! When did it get so dark outside? It was only around 5 or 6 p.m., yet now it looked like the dead of night. A strong sense of dread began to rise in your chest. Just then, the calendar stopped flipping. The date displayed was December 2, 2018, and staring at that date filled you with inexplicable fear.\n\n'No, I can’t stay here... I have to leave!' This inner voice screamed at you, filling you with terror. You turned on the office lights, trying to calm yourself. Suddenly, a man’s scream pierced through the silence, followed by the sound of hurried footsteps passing by the office. You froze in place, your nerves taut. Rushing to the door, you flung it open, only to find the hallway enveloped in total darkness—no sign of anyone.\n\nYour earlier sense of urgency was replaced by a chilling numbness. You pulled out your phone and checked the time—5:35 PM, February 26, 2019. The hallway was eerily dark, like the gaping maw of a monster, making you feel intensely uneasy. The light in the office was your only source of comfort, but your instincts told you that staying in this office might be far more dangerous than venturing out into the unknown. Reluctantly, you began moving, inching your way toward the exit. You remembered the sound of those footsteps—they belonged to someone, a man. Maybe finding him could provide some sense of security.\n\nAfter leaving the office, you cautiously made your way along the wall toward the stairs. All you had to do was leave the building and head to the security office, where you could ask the guard to escort you home. As you neared the stairs, you noticed that one of the classroom doors was slightly ajar. The sign on the door read 'Class 3, Grade 2'—your classroom.\n\nPeeking inside, the darkness within was even deeper than the hallway. The faint moonlight in the hallway at least allowed you to see shapes and outlines, but inside the classroom, it was nearly pitch black. Nevertheless, you stepped inside. Familiar surroundings should make you feel safer, right? As you fumbled around in the dark, you found the light switch and flicked it on. The fluorescent light flickered twice before flooding the room with harsh light, easing your nerves slightly. As you walked past the desks, you wondered why Class 3 had so many extra desks. The class only had 16 students—why hadn’t anyone removed the excess desks?\n\nWalking past one desk, you froze. Did something just move inside it? Bending down to check, you saw nothing—the desk was completely empty. (Your memory begins to distort, Memory Fragment 2: keyword 'note.')\n\n'BANG!' A loud noise shattered the silence, making you jump. The sound came from the large blackboard at the front of the room. In the corner of the board, a red handprint had appeared—blood-red and fresh. The fluorescent light began flickering again, casting the room in a cold, eerie glow. You watched in horror as the classroom door, which had been wide open, began to slowly close.\n\nPanic flooded you. You bolted for the door, but your desk was tucked into the corner, meaning you had to weave through rows of desks to reach it. 'Bang... Bang... Bang!' The sound grew louder and more frequent, and you saw more bloody handprints appearing on the blackboard, creeping from the corner toward the door. You crashed into several desks in your desperate rush, but it was too late—the door was nearly shut.\n\nJust as you were about to lose hope, the lights suddenly went out. Plunged into darkness, you realized that the classroom door had begun to reopen, the small gap widening. Beyond the door, you saw shadows—19 of them, all dark figures. Pale hands gripped the door, forcing it open ever so slowly. Seizing the opportunity, you dashed through the widening gap, escaping the classroom just in time.\n\nBreathless and shaken, you heard the door slam shut behind you. Relief washed over you, but something still felt wrong. Peering through the window, you saw the shadows inside—19 of them, standing motionless in the dark classroom. They seemed to be watching you. An overwhelming sense of familiarity washed over you, but you couldn’t remember why. As you stared, your gaze drifted to the blackboard, now completely covered in blood-red handprints. And then, something emerged—a massive figure, a woman’s upper body. Her long hair hung in front of her face, her pale skin drenched in red, her white clothes stained with blood. She filled the entire classroom, her giant form looming over the shadows. Slowly, she reached out with one massive hand and grabbed the shadows, pulling them into her open mouth. Her mouth stretched impossibly wide—at least two meters—and the shadows didn’t resist. Instead, they all extended their right hands, pointing upward.\n\nYou collapsed to the floor, sobbing silently, trying to stifle any noise. The woman’s terrifying form devoured the shadows in front of you, each sickening crunch echoing in your ears. If those shadows hadn’t opened the door for you, you’d be in that classroom, being devoured right now.\n\nYou lay on the floor, quietly sobbing, for what felt like an eternity. Eventually, the noises stopped, and you mustered the courage to crawl away from the door. Bending low, you inched away in silence. When you finally gained enough distance from the classroom, you broke into a run. You didn’t notice the classroom door slowly reopening behind you.\n\nThe rooftop! They were guiding me to the rooftop! I need to find Mr. Li, tell him what happened, and escape together. Truth High School is haunted! 'BANG!' The loud sound echoed again, but this time it wasn’t nearby—it came from the lower floors. You realized then that a thick fog had enveloped the building, making it impossible to see what was happening below. Unable to hold back your terror any longer, you bolted up the stairs toward the rooftop. You had no choice but to trust the shadows that helped you, even in your fear. You burst through the darkened hallway, tore open the iron door, and dashed onto the rooftop.",

            "Script": "February 27th. Today, you woke up a bit earlier than usual, feeling absentminded as you washed up. You had this nagging feeling that you'd forgotten something important, but with all the schoolwork piling up, you shrugged it off, convincing yourself it was just unnecessary worry. Once you arrived at class, you found something odd: only 13 students were present. Siqi Lv, Mu Bai, and Qingfeng Yao were absent. Had they all fallen ill at the same time? The already empty classroom felt even more desolate. You noticed Xuanxuan Li had already taken her seat. Soon, Mr. Li entered and began the day’s lesson, assigning homework as usual. After class, you found Xuanxuan Li, and the two of you chatted about topics of mutual interest. During a break, you went to the restroom and then returned, ready for the next class. (Your memory starts to distort, Memory Fragment 2: keyword 'rumor.')The day passed quickly, and you left school earlier than usual, feeling in need of a good rest. That phone call... it must have been just a hallucination or a dream, right? Truth High School has five main buildings and a cafeteria, including the First-Year Building, Second-Year Building, Third-Year Building, Administrative Building, and Dormitory. Although each building only has six floors, their size rivals even 16-floor buildings in terms of the number of classrooms and offices they contain. Scattered around are smaller one or two-story buildings, such as a performance theater and warehouses. Class 3 of Grade 2 is located on the 5th floor of the Second-Year Building. You slowly descended the stairs, noticing other classes were also beginning to let out. Students chatted and laughed, heading out with their backpacks. Once you reached the first floor, you decided to stop by the restroom to fix your hair. Looking into the mirror, you saw a cute and pretty face—the same one that earned you the title of school beauty at Truth High. You smiled at yourself in the mirror, but as you prepared to leave, the restroom lights dimmed. What was going on? You glanced toward the window, and to your shock, the sky outside had turned completely black. Confused, you hurriedly switched on the restroom lights, keeping the room from plunging into total darkness.What’s going on? An eclipse? It was only around 4 p.m., so how had it suddenly become night? Peeking out of the restroom door, you found the corridor shrouded in darkness, sending a chill through you. Girls are naturally more fearful of the dark, and this strange phenomenon only heightened your anxiety. You decided to wait it out, figuring the eclipse would pass in five minutes or so. However, after about ten minutes, the sky remained pitch black. That’s when you noticed something even more unsettling—why was everything so quiet? It was the end of the school day, and with such an unusual event happening, there should have been the excited chatter of students all around, but instead, it was eerily silent, like the dead of night.'What are you doing here?' A female voice suddenly echoed through the restroom. It didn’t sound like a peer—maybe someone older? Startled, you replied, 'Is someone there?' You glanced at the six closed stalls, trying to pinpoint where the voice was coming from. 'I’m in the restroom. What about you? What are you doing here?' the voice responded. Hearing another person’s voice reassured you a bit. 'I came to wash my hands. There’s some kind of eclipse going on outside—the sky’s gone completely dark.' 'Oh, so that’s why it got dark just now. Thanks for turning on the light. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to see you.'Her voice sounded pleased. You, trying to keep the conversation going, said, 'But even with the light on, you can’t see me from inside a stall, right?' 'Oh no, I can see you very clearly,' the voice continued, sending a chill down your spine. You glanced at the closed stalls again and asked, 'If you can see me, why can’t I see you? Where are you?' After a moment of silence, the voice replied, 'You can see me.' The response made your blood run cold. Agitated, you shouted, 'Come out and show yourself! Where are you?' 'Turn around,' the voice said, chilling you to the core.That’s when it hit you. There *was* someone else in the restroom when you entered. You *did* see them. Slowly, you turned to face the mirror behind you. Of course, she could see you—she’d been looking at you the entire time. And in the mirror, staring back at you, was a twisted, bloodied figure, her head hanging unnaturally to one side, as if her neck had been broken. The only thing keeping her head attached was a thin strip of skin and tendon. She grinned, revealing bloodstained teeth, and rasped, 'See? You can see me.'You screamed and bolted out of the restroom as fast as you could. Run! You had to run as far and as fast as possible! Outside, the entire school was blanketed in thick fog, reducing visibility to just a few meters. How could such a heavy fog roll in so quickly? As you stumbled through the mist, you collided with someone. A flashlight beam flickered in the fog, and you found yourself staring at a middle-aged man in a security guard’s uniform. You burst into tears of relief.'Which class are you from? What are you still doing in school this late?' the guard asked, surprised. 'Stop crying and tell me what happened.' Between sobs, you managed to blurt out, 'There’s a ghost! In the mirror, there’s a ghost in the restroom!' The guard turned and pointed to the restroom behind you. You froze in terror—after all that running, you were still standing right outside that same restroom! 'Go to the rooftop. It’s safer there. I’ll check the restroom,' the guard said as he headed inside with his flashlight.Terrified, you grabbed his arm. 'Don’t go in there! Please! There’s a real ghost in there, I swear!' 'Thud.' Something round fell to the ground between you and the guard. As it rolled, you caught a glimpse of a rotting face grinning up at you. 'I believe you,' the guard said, 'because I’m a ghost too.' Your heart nearly stopped as you looked back up at the guard, only to see his body still standing in front of you, headless. His head had rolled onto the ground, grinning. You let out a blood-curdling scream and dashed up the nearest staircase, racing for your life. What you didn’t see was the headless guard’s body calmly picking up his head—just before a pale hand reached out from the restroom and dragged him inside.Panicked, you ran as fast as your legs could carry you, the image of the woman from the mirror burned into your mind. You kept running, up and up the stairs, never daring to slow down. You were certain the ghost would chase you. You didn’t understand anything anymore—your thoughts were a mess. Just then, the sound of footsteps echoed through the stairwell. You glanced down, and what you saw nearly stopped your heart. The woman with the twisted neck was crawling up the stairs, her bloodstained white dress trailing behind her.This sight filled you with a terror beyond reason. You turned and bolted up the remaining stairs, running even faster than before. You reached the sixth floor, just below the rooftop, and that’s when you saw it—a bloodied, half-body lying in the stairwell. You collapsed in fear, completely paralyzed. At that moment, someone rushed up the stairs—it was Lengxing Ye! He saw the half-body too, his face pale, but he gritted his teeth and helped you to your feet. 'We need to get to the rooftop. It’s not safe here,' he said, pulling you up the final steps toward the rooftop door.",

            "Script": "You were deeply asleep, trapped in countless nightmares. You dreamt of being chased by ghosts and torn apart by them. When you finally woke up, your head felt heavy, and you quickly reached for a glass of water, downing it in one go. Suddenly, a sharp pain split through your head. 'What happened? When did I even get back to the dorm?' You massaged your temples, trying to recall but found no memory of how you returned. You felt a strange heat emanating from your chest—the source was the 'Spirit Jade' you always wore around your neck. Normally a vibrant green, the jade was now faintly glowing red. That wasn’t a good sign.\n\nYou looked around—it was pitch black. 'Is it still nighttime?' You flicked the switch to turn on the dorm lights, then checked your phone. The time was 11:49 PM. 'That late already?' Your stomach growled loudly. After all, you had fallen asleep without eating dinner, and at this hour, there would be no place to find food. Your dorm wasn’t small; it had four beds, yet you were the only occupant. The school had never assigned anyone else to stay with you. It used to feel normal, but now, the emptiness felt eerie. Too cold... too quiet. You shook your head, trying to brush off the feeling of unease. Flipping through your phone, you noticed an audio file. It seemed unfamiliar, and out of curiosity, you tried to play it, only to get an error: 'File corrupted.' Disappointed, you pocketed your phone. (Your memory begins to distort, Memory Fragment 2: keyword 'audio.')\n\nSuddenly, a scream pierced the night, echoing through the quiet campus. The scream seemed to come from the direction of the school building, and what really shocked you was how familiar the scream sounded. It... it sounded like you! How is that possible? The realization made you jump out of bed—something was wrong! You had to investigate. You opened the dorm door, and as you stepped outside, you froze. A thick fog blanketed the entire campus, visibility reduced to just a few feet ahead of you. 'What’s going on? It was bright and sunny earlier today!' Confused but determined, you made your way toward the school building. Despite the fog, you could make out the vague outline of the building in the distance.\n\nCrossing a patch of grass, you approached the school and noticed something strange—a figure lay on the ground, motionless. The sight of someone lying there, shrouded in fog, immediately sent a wave of anxiety through you. You moved closer and realized with horror that you knew this person—Mu Bai! His eyes were wide open, filled with terror, and a pool of blood spread from a large gaping wound in his chest. His organs... they were all missing. You stumbled backward, barely holding back the urge to vomit.\n\nIn a panic, you scrambled toward the school, running into the building. Once inside, you crouched at the second-floor stairwell, fumbling to dial emergency services. To your shock, no matter how many times you tried, your phone kept showing 'out of service.' Your heart raced. What was going on? Determined, you decided to head to the security office to find the night guard.\n\nJust as you started moving, the sound of footsteps echoed from above. Instinctively, you hid around the corner and peeked out cautiously. Coming down the stairs was... Xuanxuan Li? You were about to call out to her but immediately stopped. Something was wrong. Xuanxuan moved as if in a trance, her face completely expressionless as she descended the steps, her movements slow and mechanical.\n\nHolding your breath, you watched her move down the stairs, step by step. Then, without warning, she stopped. Her back was turned to you, standing motionless on the staircase. Suddenly, without moving her body, her head twisted 180 degrees to face you. That’s impossible! Your heart nearly stopped as a cold smile crept across her face. 'Gotcha,' she whispered before lunging at you with inhuman speed.\n\nYou screamed and bolted up the stairs, heart pounding. Run! Run faster! You wished for more legs as you sprinted up, but no matter how fast you moved, Xuanxuan closed in. This... this wasn’t Xuanxuan! No human’s head could turn like that! This place is haunted! You had to escape! But no matter how fast you ran, she was faster. You glanced back and saw her face contorting—her once-beautiful face was now a monstrous, gaping maw of sharp teeth. Just as she was about to grab you, a large hand appeared out of nowhere, grabbing Xuanxuan by the neck and yanking her back down the stairs.\n\nXuanxuan shrieked in frustration, her eyes filled with hatred as she stared at you. The one dragging her away was a headless figure, dressed in the uniform of a school security guard. You watched in disbelief as the two spirits fought each other. There was no time to process this—you had to get out! You sprinted up to the sixth floor and froze when you reached the entrance to the rooftop.\n\nShould you go up? But before you could decide, Xuanxuan's piercing scream echoed through the stairwell again, getting closer. She was coming! Without a second thought, you dashed through the darkness, flung open the iron door, and raced up to the rooftop.",

            "Script": "On February 27th, you woke up groggily, feeling disoriented. When exactly did you go to bed last night? You couldn’t recall. After your usual breakfast, you went to class. Something was off today—three students, [Mu Bai], [Siqi Lv], and [Qingfeng Yao], were absent. This left only 13 people in the classroom, making the already spacious room feel even more empty. As the class monitor, you were frustrated by their unexplained absence. Such behavior seemed irresponsible, and you resolved to visit their dorms after school to find out why they skipped class.\n\nThe day passed quickly, and after the final bell rang, you were the first to pack up and head out. Your destination was the dormitory to find [Mu Bai], who you were closest with. The dormitory building was bustling with life—students laughing, carrying water basins, some washing their hair—it was the typical after-school chaos. The noise lightened your mood slightly, even relaxing your previously furrowed brows.\n\nYou arrived on the 4th floor, which housed the second-year students. Since it was after school, the iron gate was open. However, as you walked further in, the laughter and noise slowly faded. Oddly, all the dorm room doors were open, but not a single person was in sight. Since you didn’t know exactly which room [Mu Bai] stayed in, you initially planned to ask other students. Yet, with the entire 4th floor deserted, your plan was moot. The sky had visibly darkened, and in one glance, what had previously been a dim twilight seemed to have plunged into pitch-black night.\n\nSuddenly, the dorm hallway’s motion-sensitive lights flickered on, saving you from being enveloped in darkness. You looked up at the sky—was this a solar eclipse? But that couldn’t be right. Eclipses don’t happen at dusk. Besides, a thick fog had rolled in, concealing the world beyond the dormitory. You decided to investigate one of the dorm rooms. Inside, the place was a mess—comics and empty drink bottles strewn everywhere. Typical messy boys’ dorm. But this wasn’t [Mu Bai]’s room, so you tried another. Still, no sign of him. The third attempt yielded the same result. Finally, on your fourth try, something caught your attention. The room was spotless—immaculately clean, with two bunk beds, all the sheets neatly folded. This was in stark contrast to the other rooms. Strange.\n\nApproaching a desk, you saw various textbooks and stationery neatly arranged. You picked up one of the books, noticing it was a high-school revision guide with no name written on it. Losing interest, you placed it back down and turned to leave, but something by the pillow on one of the beds caught your eye—a blue notebook. You didn’t pay it much attention. (Your memory starts to distort, Memory Fragment 2: keyword 'dorm.') You grabbed a red pen from the desk and ripped out a few blank sheets of paper, planning to jot down all the odd things you had encountered, trying to make sense of them, as you always did.\n\nSuddenly, you heard a loud 'BANG!' Turning around, you saw that the dorm door had slammed shut. 'Must have been the wind,' you thought, though you weren’t sure. Walking over to push it open, you found the door wouldn’t budge, no matter how hard you pushed. Was it broken? And then, the lights in the dorm began to dim—not a sudden blackout, but a gradual, suffocating darkness. Everything around you faded into pitch black. You called out in desperation: 'Is anyone there? Can anyone hear me? I’m trapped in here!' But no one responded.\n\nFrom the moment you set foot on the fourth floor, something had felt terribly wrong. Why were all the dorm doors open? Where had all the students gone? And why had the sky suddenly darkened? Now, thinking back on it, an icy dread crept over you. You didn’t dare shout anymore, fearing that your voice might wake something unknown.\n\nPulling out your phone, the dim screen offered you the smallest sense of comfort. But that comfort vanished in an instant as you heard it—a faint breathing sound, coming from the darkness. Your heart skipped a beat. 'Who’s there?' you asked, your voice trembling. Silence. The dorm wasn’t that large, and you could see all of it from where you stood—there was no place for anyone to hide. Or was there? The thought hit you like a lightning bolt: under the bed. Had someone been hiding under there all along?\n\nAnother soft breath, closer this time. Your entire body tensed up, and you clung to the wall for support, barely able to keep from collapsing. You’d always prided yourself on being rational and brave, but right now, you realized that in the face of true fear, you were no braver than anyone else. 'Who… who’s there…? Don’t play tricks, please…' Your voice cracked, barely audible now.\n\nThe breathing came again, this time, right next to your ear.\n\nWith a terrified scream, you flung yourself at the door, pounding on it with all your might. At that moment, you would have done anything to break it down. And then, something clicked in your mind, as if an old memory resurfaced: 'Go to the rooftop… through the window…' You had no idea what the message truly meant, but those two words—'window' and 'rooftop'—stood out to you now. Without a second thought, you abandoned the door and sprinted toward the window, the only spot where faint moonlight filtered in.\n\nThis was the 4th floor of the dormitory. Jumping from here would mean certain death. But right now, there were no other options. If you stayed, you’d die in that room, no question. You ran toward the window, bracing yourself for the impact and the inevitable fall. But it didn’t come. No glass shattered, no sensation of plummeting to your death. Instead, you found yourself standing in the hallway, the dim motion-sensitive lights flickering on as you caught your breath.\n\nYou looked around, dazed. Behind you, the dorm room stood dark, but at the door’s threshold, you saw something that made your blood run cold. Strands of hair hung down, trailing from the door frame, and a pale face peeked out—just the top half, revealing nothing but two eyes. Those eyes glared at you with intense malice, like a bat hanging in a cave.\n\nYou bolted, your mind reeling. You had to escape. As you ran, everything began to make sense—the moment you’d heard the door slam shut, you had been trapped in some kind of illusion. The door hadn’t really closed; you had just imagined it. No wonder you couldn’t force it open—it wasn’t real. The true exit had always been at the window, cleverly disguised by your mind. As the thought clicked, you resolved to follow the message from the text: the rooftop. The message had already saved your life once, and maybe, just maybe, the rooftop held the answers.\n\nYour only choice now was to trust that mysterious text message. 'Window' had already saved you—maybe 'rooftop' was the next clue. Rushing toward the school building, you felt a renewed sense of determination. As you neared the rear of the building, you glimpsed a figure lying on the ground through the fog. Your heart skipped a beat, but after everything you had just experienced, you dared not check any closer. You sped up, sprinting straight into the school building.\n\nYour excellent physical fitness allowed you to sprint all the way to the 6th floor without pausing. There, at the top of the stairs, you saw it—a half-torso, a bloodied corpse slumped on the floor. Your throat tightened, and your voice failed you. Beside the corpse sat [Yuqing Xie], her face as pale as the body beside her.\n\nClenching your jaw, you rushed over, grabbing her by the arm. 'Come on! It’s not safe here—we need to get to the rooftop!' Without waiting for her to respond, you pulled her up and raced toward the rooftop together.",

            "Script": "You burst through the iron door onto the rooftop, collapsing onto the ground. Darkness and thick fog engulfed the open space, and through the haze, you could faintly make out solar panels, antennas, and water tanks scattered across the rooftop. There was no guardrail along the perimeter, and the fog made the area dangerously treacherous—one misstep could send you plummeting over the edge.\n\nDespite the eerie atmosphere, being in the open air felt like a relief compared to the oppressive darkness of the stairwell. However, you knew it was a false sense of security—there was only one way off the rooftop, the iron door leading to the stairwell. If someone or something blocked the door, you would have no way to escape.\n\nAs you took in your surroundings, you noticed three familiar figures standing nearby, staring at you in equal confusion. It was your classmates, Qingfeng Yao, Siqi Lv, and Xuanxuan Li. You couldn’t believe they were here too, but seeing familiar faces filled you with relief. In such a terrifying situation, even the presence of people you didn’t particularly like was comforting.\n\nYou struggled to your feet and staggered toward them, exhausted from the series of terrifying events and the relentless running. Moments later, more footsteps echoed up the stairwell, and the iron door opened again. This time, it was Fuqing Huang. His face was pale, clearly shaken by something horrible. Following close behind were Lengxing Ye and Yuqing Xie. Lengxing was practically dragging Yuqing along—she looked too frightened to even walk properly. With everyone present, the seven students of Class 3 had all gathered on the rooftop.\n\nStill trembling from fear, you all sat down together, trying to make sense of what was happening. Qingfeng Yao mentioned finding a black phone on the rooftop when he arrived. Siqi Lv recognized it as Mr. Li’s phone. Lengxing Ye suggested that everyone share their experiences to see if they could find any clues to explain the bizarre events you’d all encountered so far. Everyone agreed, and Lengxing pulled out a notebook and pen, ready to document the strange occurrences.\n\nYou noticed something odd—the jade pendant around Qingfeng’s neck, which was usually a vibrant green, had turned a vivid, blood-red color. You had no idea what that could mean.\n\nThe discussion went on for about thirty minutes. During that time, you discovered another identical black phone on the rooftop. The phones were exactly the same, down to the wallpaper and contact lists—it was as if they had been copied. Both phones had traces of blood on them, and after inspecting them, you realized they had identical contents, except for one crucial difference: one phone had sent a message, while the other had received it. The message? 'Come to the rooftop.' It had been sent from 'My Number' to 'My Number.'\n\nJust as you were trying to piece together the mystery, hurried footsteps echoed up the stairwell again, freezing everyone in place. Could there be another student trapped in the school? The iron door creaked open, and a figure stumbled onto the rooftop, leaving you all pale with fear. It was Lengxing Ye.\n\nHow could there be two Lengxing Yes? Everyone jumped to their feet, instinctively backing away from the Lengxing standing among you. One of them had to be an imposter, a ghost in disguise! The real Lengxing looked just as shocked as the rest of you, staring wide-eyed at the other Lengxing who had just entered.\n\nThe new Lengxing seemed unfazed by your terror. In fact, he looked relieved to see you all. Reaching into his clothes, he pulled out a piece of paper and began walking toward you. The paper was identical to the one the Lengxing among you had been using to document your conversation, covered in the same cramped handwriting.\n\nBefore any of you could react, something unimaginable happened. A massive, pale hand reached down from above and grabbed the Lengxing who had just entered, lifting him effortlessly into the air. He was as small as a sparrow in its enormous grip. You stared in horror as the hand slowly pulled him up over your heads.\n\nFollowing the path of the hand, you saw it emerging from the water tank! Another pale hand reached out from the tank, followed by a twisted body with limbs that seemed to have no bones. A towering, spectral woman rose from the tank, her long hair floating around her pale, ghastly face. She was impossibly large, her cold, dead eyes filled with hatred as she glared down at you from above. You all trembled as if struck by an icy winter wind, unable to tear your eyes away from her monstrous form.\n\nThe spectral woman opened her mouth—a gaping, bloody maw that stretched over two meters wide. Slowly, the hand holding the second Lengxing lowered him into her mouth, and the terrible sound of her chewing echoed through the night, like the sound of a nightmare made real. As she devoured him, he managed to shout a final, desperate warning: 'Don’t run! Whatever you do, don’t split up!' These were his last words before he was completely swallowed.\n\n'RUN!!!' The scream came from Yuqing Xie, who had already lost all sense of reason. She turned and bolted for the iron door, racing down the stairwell. Panic spread like wildfire, and everyone scrambled to follow her, fleeing the rooftop in blind terror. Despite your exhaustion, fear gave you a surge of adrenaline, and you ran faster than you ever thought possible, your mind consumed by a single thought: escape!\n\nAs you barreled down the dark stairwell, the others’ footsteps gradually faded. Soon, it was just you, running alone through the suffocating blackness.\n\n'Why am I still here?' you wondered in terror. 'I should have reached the ground floor by now, but I’m still stuck in this stairwell!' You had lost count of how many flights of stairs you’d descended, yet you hadn’t reached the bottom. Out of breath and on the verge of collapse, you finally stopped to catch your breath. You couldn’t keep running—you’d die from exhaustion before anything else could get to you.\n\n'Plop... plop... plop...' A soft sound reached your ears. Footsteps. But not yours.\n\n'Who’s there?' you called out, your voice trembling. No one answered, but the footsteps continued. They were coming from below—someone was walking up the stairs.\n\nBut it wasn’t any of your classmates. None of them would be walking this slowly, not while fleeing for their lives. And they certainly wouldn’t be walking *up* the stairs.\n\nTerror gripped you. Whoever—or whatever—was coming, you didn’t want to meet it. You turned and fled up the stairs, climbing higher and higher, but your legs felt like lead. Eventually, your strength gave out, and you collapsed against the wall, sliding down into a corner. The footsteps kept coming.\n\nYour phone! Maybe you could use it to find your way out. You fumbled in the darkness, pulling your phone from your pocket. When you turned it on, the light illuminated something you hadn’t noticed before, and your eyes widened in horror.\n\nFrom the beginning, something had been wrong. The stairwell shouldn’t have been this dark. When you first arrived, you could see well enough to find your way, but now it was pitch black, impossible to navigate.\n\nAnd then you realized why. A pair of pale hands had been covering your eyes all along, guiding you through the stairwell, preventing you from seeing the way out. The hands slowly withdrew, and as they did, the sound of countless footsteps echoed all around you.\n\nYou pointed your phone’s light forward, and your heart nearly stopped. The stairwell was filled with ghosts—dozens of them. Women in blood-soaked school uniforms, their faces streaked with gore. Some were high schoolers, others wore middle school and even elementary school uniforms, but all of them had been dyed red with blood. They filled the stairwell, clinging to the walls, the ceiling, everywhere. Behind you, one of those pale hands gripped your shoulder. You turned around and saw her—Xuanxuan Li, just like the other ghosts, her eyes burning with hatred.\n\nShe opened her mouth wide, wider than any human mouth should go, and bit into your neck, tearing out a chunk of flesh. As the other ghosts swarmed over you, their jaws opening wide, the sound of ripping flesh and your final, desperate screams echoed through the empty stairwell.\n\nThose screams would be the last sound you ever made.",

            "Script": "You collapse onto the rooftop, the oppressive fog and darkness surrounding you. The rooftop is large, the size of several basketball courts, with faint outlines of solar panels, water tanks, and antennas barely visible through the thick mist. The edges of the rooftop have no safety railings, and in the fog, one misstep could send you plummeting over the side.\n\nDespite the overwhelming darkness, being outdoors feels better than the oppressive stairwells below. But you know this sense of security is false—the only exit is the iron door leading back into the school. If something blocks that door, you’ll have no escape.\n\nAs you regain your breath, you notice four other people staring at you with the same shocked expressions. They’re your classmates: Qingfeng Yao, Mu Bai, Siqi Lv, and Xuanxuan Li—the three students who didn’t come to school today. Seeing them sends a chill down your spine. The closer you get to the truth, the more dangerous it becomes. But you’ve steeled yourself, prepared to face death if it means uncovering the truth and finding Wenling.\n\nYou force yourself to your feet, staggering toward them. Moments later, more footsteps echo from the stairwell. Then, two more people emerge—Lengxing Ye and Yuqing Xie, with Lengxing practically dragging the terrified Yuqing along. Now, all seven students from Class 3 are on the rooftop.\n\nStill shaken, you all find a place to sit down. Qingfeng mentions finding a black phone on the rooftop, which Siqi recognizes as belonging to Mr. Li, your teacher. Lengxing suggests that everyone share their experiences to see if there are any clues that might explain the strange events. Everyone agrees, and Lengxing pulls out a notebook and pen, ready to record the bizarre occurrences.\n\nThe discussion lasts about thirty minutes. During that time, you find another identical black phone on the rooftop. Everything about it is the same as the first phone—wallpaper, contacts, everything. It’s like they were copied. Both phones are stained with small amounts of blood. When you check the messages, you find one key difference: one phone sent a message reading 'Come to the rooftop' to 'My Number.' The other phone received the same message from 'My Number.'\n\nJust as you’re trying to piece it all together, hurried footsteps echo from the stairwell again. Everyone freezes. Could there be another student trapped in the school? The old iron door creaks open, and a figure stumbles onto the rooftop, sending chills through everyone. It’s Lengxing Ye.\n\nHow could there be two Lengxing Yes? Everyone jumps to their feet, instinctively backing away from the Lengxing standing among you. One of them must be an imposter, a ghost in disguise! Even Lengxing himself looks shocked, staring wide-eyed at the doppelgänger.\n\nThe new Lengxing, however, looks relieved to see you. He pulls out a piece of paper and walks toward you, showing it to the group. It’s identical to the paper Lengxing had been using to record your conversation, filled with the same cramped handwriting.\n\nBefore anyone can react, something unimaginable happens. A giant pale hand swoops down from above and snatches the second Lengxing, lifting him into the air like a bird in its claws. You all stare in horror as the hand slowly pulls him up over your heads.\n\nFollowing the hand, you see it emerging from the water tank. Another pale hand reaches out from the tank, and then, like a boneless figure, a twisted, massive woman rises from within. Her long hair floats around her ghostly white face, her cold, dead eyes full of hatred. She towers over you, her monstrous form sending shivers down your spine as you cower beneath her.\n\nThe spectral woman opens her mouth—a bloody maw stretching over two meters wide. She lowers the second Lengxing into her mouth and begins to chew, the nightmare sound filling your ears. In his final moments, the second Lengxing manages to shout: 'Don’t run! Whatever you do, don’t split up!' Those are his last words before he is completely devoured.\n\n'RUN!!!' Yuqing Xie screams in terror, already bolting for the iron door. Everyone else follows in blind panic, racing down the stairwell, their courage shattered. You too sprint away from the rooftop, your only thought to escape. You know there’s no safety anywhere in the school—not with that giant spectral woman on the loose.\n\nYou race down the stairs, heart pounding, and reach the first floor. A headless body lies sprawled on the ground—it’s the security guard who was eaten earlier. Ignoring the revulsion rising in your throat, you dash toward the school gates. The fog has cleared slightly, and you can now see the gate across the courtyard. Freedom is just beyond it.\n\nYou sprint across the field and reach the gate, but it’s an electronic gate with no easy way to climb over. Frantically, you run into the nearby security booth, searching for the gate key. The booth looks just like it did when you first entered. You tear through drawers and cabinets, searching desperately. You can hear the distant screams of your classmates as they are hunted down one by one. You pale at the sound and start searching even faster.\n\nBut there’s no key! You glance at the security office’s small inner room, a place where the guards sleep. In a moment of desperation, you rush inside, scanning the room. It’s simple—just a bed and a small TV. Finally, you spot a keyring by the bed, the keys jingling. In your excitement, you accidentally drop the keyring onto the floor.\n\nAs you kneel to pick it up, you realize with horror that the keyring isn’t moving. No matter how hard you pull, it won’t budge. Your blood runs cold when you see why. A pale hand is gripping the keyring from under the bed, preventing you from taking it.\n\nFollowing the hand with your eyes, you see two eyes glaring back at you from beneath the bed—Mr. Li’s eyes! Another pale hand shoots out, grabbing your arm and pulling you under the bed.\n\n'NO!!!!!!' Your final scream echoes through the empty security booth.\n\nThis is the last sound you’ll ever make.",

Another hand emerges from the tank, followed by a grotesque, contorted body. A giant pale woman with ghostly white skin and lifeless eyes towers over you, her hair floating around her face like a dark cloud. Her gaze is filled with a cold, deadly malice.\n\nThe spectral woman opens her mouth—a bloody maw stretching over two meters wide.

Without thinking, you throw open the door and slam it shut behind you. Breathing heavily, you lean against the door, telling yourself that the white-clad ghost woman won’t follow you here. You hope, you pray.\n\nThen, you hear it—the screams. The agonizing, heart-wrenching screams of your classmates as they are hunted down one by one. The fear overwhelms you, and you collapse to the floor, covering your ears. You don’t want to hear them. You can’t bear to hear them begging for their lives.\n\n'Hee hee...hee hee hee...' A soft, eerie giggle breaks through the silence, sending a chill down your spine. Your skin crawls, and for a moment, you forget to breathe.\n\n'Hee hee...hee hee hee hee...' The sound is getting closer, closer, until it feels like it’s right beside you. Your heart races, your body trembling as you scan the room, trying to find the source of the laughter. The room is dark, except for the faint light from outside.\n\n'Siqi? Yuqing? Is that you?' Your voice shakes as you call out to the room. 'Please...please don’t scare me. Come out...'\n\n'Hee hee...hee hee...' The sound seems to come from the wardrobe. Your father’s wardrobe, where he usually hangs his coat. Your legs tremble as you slowly walk toward it. You can barely breathe, your hand shaking as you reach for the handle.\n\n'I’m not afraid of you!' you scream, yanking the wardrobe door open.\n\nThe wardrobe is empty. Relief washes over you for a brief moment, but as you move to close the door, your eyes catch something—a mirror on the inside of the wardrobe door.\n\nIn the mirror, you see your own reflection...and something else.\n\nA ghostly infant clings to your back, its pale, bony fingers gripping your shoulder. Its eyes are full of hatred, and its mouth is open in a wide, unnatural grin. That’s when you realize...the laughter you’ve been hearing has been coming from this creature, perched on your back the entire time.\n\n'NO!!!' you scream, but it’s too late. Another ghostly infant crawls out of the wardrobe, and together, they drag you down into the depths of the wardrobe’s shadowy abyss.\n\nYour final scream echoes through the office.\n\nAnd then, the wardrobe doors quietly close shut.",

There's no protective fence around the edge, making it perilous—one misstep, and you could easily fall off the roof into the abyss below.\n\nEven though it's dark, being out in the open feels much safer than the narrow, suffocating stairwells below. But deep down, you know this is just an illusion. The only exit is the iron door leading back to the stairs.

You jump, your heart racing—any noise in a place this desolate could send anyone into a panic. But after everything you've been through tonight, you manage to steady yourself. When no ghosts appear, you relax slightly. You begin to follow the sound cautiously, not wanting to walk too quickly in case the fog hides a dangerous fall.\n\nAs you approach the source of the sound, you see a black phone lying near the large water tank. Just as you're about to pick it up, the sound of footsteps makes your blood run cold. You quickly duck behind the water tank, peeking out as the iron door screeches open and a figure steps onto the rooftop, looking around in a panic. Slowly, the figure starts walking toward the ringing phone. When they get closer, you recognize them—it's your classmate, Qingfeng Yao.\n\nThe phone stops ringing just as he reaches it.

A gigantic pale woman with white skin and lifeless eyes rises from the tank. Her hair flows around her like a dark cloud. She towers over you, her gaze filled with cold, venomous hatred. The sight of her makes your whole body tremble as if winter’s chill has seeped into your bones.\n\nThe woman opens her mouth—a bloody maw stretching over two meters wide.

You all race down the stairs.\n\nIn the chaos, you trip on the stairs and fall hard. As your classmates rush past, no one stops to help. You're left alone in the darkness, tears streaming down your face as you realize this might be the end.\n\nJust as you lose hope, someone grabs you and pulls you to your feet. It’s Xuanxuan Li. 'Don’t give up!' she says breathlessly, helping you down the stairs.\n\nYou thank her between sobs, and she reassures you, 'We’ll hide in my father’s office. Just hold on a little longer.' You nod weakly, and together you make your way to the fifth floor.\n\nYou reach Mr. Li’s office and slam the door shut behind you. Both of you collapse on the floor, exhausted but grateful to have found a moment of safety.\n\nThat’s when you hear it—footsteps. Light, slow, deliberate. Those aren’t the footsteps of your classmates. Everyone is running for their lives. Whoever—or whatever—is outside the door is walking as if they have all the time in the world.\n\n'It’s her,' Xuanxuan whispers, her face pale. 'The white-clad woman. She’s coming for us.'\n\nWithout hesitation, Xuanxuan pulls you toward the wardrobe in the corner. 'Hide in here!' she whispers urgently, pushing you inside. She crawls in after you, and the two of you shut the doors, holding your breath.\n\nThe footsteps grow closer, stopping right outside the door. Your heart races so loudly you’re sure the ghost can hear it. You cover your mouth with your hand, trying not to make a sound.\n\nThe door creaks open.\n\nThrough a crack in the wardrobe, you see the white-clad woman enter the room. Her hair hangs down, covering her face, but you can feel her cold, malevolent gaze searching the office.\n\nTears stream down your face as you pray that she doesn’t find you. Xuanxuan presses her finger to her lips, signaling you to stay quiet. You do as she says, but a thought nags at you. Why is Xuanxuan being so calm? When did you two become so close? You’ve barely spoken before tonight, yet she risked her life to save you.\n\nThen it hits you like a punch to the gut. Something is wrong.\n\nThe white-clad woman stands in front of the wardrobe, her hand resting on the door handle. But instead of opening it, she smiles—a cold, eerie smile. She pulls out a lock and chains the wardrobe shut from the outside.\n\nYour blood runs cold as you realize the truth. Xuanxuan...she’s one of them.\n\nYour hands tremble as you pull out your phone, using its faint glow to look at her. In the dim light, you see her face—her mouth twisted into a grotesque grin, her eyes filled with malice. Her mouth opens wide, revealing rows of sharp, bloodstained teeth.\n\nThis...this is the last thing you see before everything goes dark.",

            "Story": "",
            "Script": "Lengxing Ye practically dragged you up onto the rooftop. Darkness and thick fog immediately greeted you. The rooftop, expansive and open, was eerily reminiscent of a large sports field, spanning four or five basketball courts. Through the mist, you could barely make out the shapes of solar panels, water tanks, and antennas scattered around the edges. There was no safety railing, and the lack of visibility made it incredibly dangerous—you could easily step too close to the edge and fall into the void.\n\nDespite the eerie surroundings, being outside felt less oppressive than the claustrophobic stairwells below. The wide-open space provided a sense of safety, albeit a false one. You knew the only way down was through the iron door that led to the stairwell. If that exit were blocked, there would be no escape.\n\nAs you caught your breath, you noticed several other figures standing nearby, staring at you and Lengxing in shock. It was the rest of your classmates from Class 3—Qingfeng Yao, Siqi Lv, Xuanxuan Li, Mu Bai, and the transfer student, Fuqing Huang. All seven of you had somehow ended up here, on the rooftop.\n\nRelieved to be among familiar faces, you felt a small sense of comfort. In such a terrifying situation, it didn’t matter if you liked these people or not. You were just happy to not be alone. Lengxing helped you stagger over to join the group. After everything you had endured, both mentally and physically, you were on the verge of collapse. Your heart was racing, your mind still reeling from the horrors you had witnessed.\n\nOnce you all gathered, Qingfeng mentioned that he had found a black phone on the rooftop. Siqi recognized it as Mr. Li’s phone. Lengxing suggested that everyone share what they had experienced in an attempt to find clues that could explain the strange occurrences. The group agreed, and Lengxing pulled out a notebook and pen, diligently recording the bizarre events everyone described.\n\nThe discussion lasted for about thirty minutes. During that time, another black phone was discovered on the rooftop—identical to the first. Both phones had the same wallpaper, the same contacts, even the same bloodstains. It was as if the phones were copies of one another. However, there was one key difference between the two: one phone had sent a message that read, 'Come to the rooftop,' to 'My Number,' while the other had received that same message, also from 'My Number.'\n\nJust as you were starting to piece things together, you heard hurried footsteps from the stairwell again. Everyone froze. Could there be more students trapped in the school? The rusty iron door creaked open, and another person stumbled onto the rooftop. What you saw made your blood run cold. The figure was Lengxing Ye.\n\nHow could there be two Lengxing Yes? Panic set in as everyone jumped to their feet. You screamed in terror, and the rest of the group backed away, putting as much distance as possible between themselves and the Lengxing standing beside you. One of them was an imposter—a ghost in disguise. The real Lengxing looked just as shocked, staring wide-eyed at the doppelgänger.\n\nThe new Lengxing didn’t seem concerned. In fact, he smiled and pulled out a piece of paper, walking toward the group. The paper was identical to the one the real Lengxing had been using to take notes, covered in the same cramped handwriting. That’s when the unimaginable happened.\n\nA massive, pale hand descended from the sky, snatching the second Lengxing like a bird plucking a mouse from the ground. The hand was enormous, and it slowly pulled the imposter Lengxing into the air.\n\nYou all looked up and saw that the hand belonged to a grotesque, towering figure rising from the water tank. Another hand emerged from the tank, followed by a twisted, ghostly body. A giant pale woman, her face ghastly white and her hair flowing wildly around her, loomed over you. Her eyes were dull and lifeless, but filled with a chilling malice.\n\nThe monstrous woman opened her mouth—a gaping maw nearly two meters wide, dripping with blood. You watched in horror as she lifted the fake Lengxing toward her mouth and began to chew. The sound of bones crunching echoed in your ears, a sound that would haunt you forever.\n\nIn his final moments, the second Lengxing shouted desperately: 'Don’t run! Whatever you do, don’t split up!' Those were his last words before he was swallowed whole.\n\nThat was when you completely lost control. Screaming, you bolted for the iron door, fleeing down the stairwell without looking back. Everyone else followed suit, their fear shattering any sense of composure. You ran as fast as you could, your mind consumed with a single thought: Escape.\n\nYou sprinted down the stairs, floor after floor, trying to outrun the horror behind you. But it was no use. Your legs were burning, your lungs screaming for air, and you couldn’t keep up the pace. Desperation took over as you ducked into a bathroom on the fifth floor, locking yourself in the last stall.\n\nThe bathroom was dimly lit, but even that small bit of light was a relief after the darkness of the stairwell. You crouched in the corner, trying to control your ragged breathing. As long as you stayed hidden, maybe the ghost wouldn’t find you.\n\nBut then you heard the screams—first Qingfeng’s, then Siqi’s. Each one sent a fresh wave of terror through your body. Tears streamed down your face as you clamped a hand over your mouth, trying to stifle your sobs. You didn’t want to be next.\n\n'Click...click...click...' Footsteps. Soft and slow, they echoed through the bathroom. Your heart pounded in your chest as the steps drew closer. Please don’t find me. Please don’t find me! you silently begged.\n\nThe footsteps stopped. Silence filled the air, and for a moment, you thought you might be safe. But then, you heard a knock—'Tap...tap...tap...'—on the first stall door. The door creaked open.\n\n'Tap...tap...tap...' The second door. The third. The fourth.\n\nThey were getting closer.\n\n'Tap...tap...tap...' The fifth stall door opened. Next would be yours.\n\nYou couldn’t breathe. You couldn’t move. The terror was too overwhelming. You stared at the door in front of you, praying that the ghost would somehow pass you by. But the knock never came.\n\nInstead, you heard nothing. No footsteps. No knocking. Just silence. Maybe...maybe it’s gone? you thought, your mind grasping at hope.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, you slowly reached for the stall door, ready to make your escape. But just as your hand touched the door handle, you froze.\n\nThe shadows inside the stall...why were they so much bigger now?\n\nYou looked up, and that’s when you saw her. A woman with disheveled hair, her neck grotesquely twisted, stared down at you from above the stall. Her eyes were filled with hatred, and her mouth opened wide—far too wide for any normal human.\n\nIn that moment, you realized the truth: she had been watching you the entire time. She never needed to knock on your door. She could see you from the fifth stall, her head twisted unnaturally to peer into yours.\n\nThe last thing you saw was her gaping maw descending toward you.\n\nYour final scream echoed through the empty bathroom.",

            "Script": "Darkness and thick fog surround you as you stand on the rooftop. The rooftop feels vast, as big as four or five basketball courts, with solar panels, a water tank, and antennae barely visible through the mist. There's no safety rail, and in the dense fog, a single misstep could send you tumbling off the edge. Despite the eerie environment, the open air feels safer than the dark, claustrophobic stairwells you left behind. But you know this sense of security is false. There's only one exit: the iron door leading down to the stairs. If that door gets blocked, you’ll have no escape. Still, you take some comfort in knowing that the ghost hasn't followed you up here.\n\nInstinctively, you glance at the 'spirit jade' hanging around your neck. It has completely turned a blood-red color, far more vibrant than the faint red it had been earlier.\n\nSuddenly, a soft, cheerful ringtone shatters the silence, startling you. Hearing a phone ring in this dark, deserted environment would frighten anyone. You cautiously follow the sound, walking slowly to avoid the dense fog that might obscure the edge of the rooftop. As you approach the source of the noise near the water tank, the phone stops ringing. You hesitate for a moment, and just as you’re about to reach for the phone lying on the ground, a figure suddenly appears from behind the tank.\n\nThe sight startles you, but you quickly realize it’s not a ghost—it’s one of your classmates, Siqi Lv. Though you've never been particularly fond of her, seeing a familiar face brings immense relief in this terrifying situation. After briefly discussing your experiences, you both turn your attention to the black phone lying on the ground. Siqi picks it up, her face suddenly going pale.\n\n'It's Mr. Li's phone!' she exclaims.\n\nYour heart skips a beat. If this is Mr. Li’s phone, where is he? What happened to him?\n\nAt that moment, more footsteps echo from the stairwell. Thanks to Siqi’s presence, you're frightened but not panicking. The iron door creaks open, and another figure stumbles onto the rooftop—Li Xuanxuan, another classmate. Though you’re initially alarmed, you quickly realize she looks just as terrified as you do. More footsteps follow, and soon Mu Bai, Fuqing Huang, Lengxing Ye, and Yuqing Xie emerge. Lengxing is practically dragging a trembling Yuqing. Now, all seven members of Class 3 are on the rooftop.\n\nStill shaken, you all gather and sit down. You tell the others about finding the black phone. Siqi identifies it as Mr. Li's, and Lengxing suggests that everyone share their experiences to try and piece together what's happening. Everyone agrees, and Lengxing pulls out a notebook and starts jotting down the strange occurrences.\n\nFor thirty minutes, you discuss the events. During that time, another black phone identical to the first one is found on the rooftop. The wallpaper, contacts, and everything else about it are identical to the first phone. It's as if they were copied. Both phones have faint traces of blood on them. You check the messages and find one key difference: one phone sent a message saying, 'Come to the rooftop,' to 'My Number.' The other received the exact same message from 'My Number.'\n\nBefore you can fully process this, more footsteps echo from the stairwell. Could there be another student trapped in the school? The door creaks open again, and everyone freezes.\n\nStepping through the doorway is...Lengxing Ye.\n\nThere are two Lengxing Yes.\n\nPanic spreads through the group as you all scramble backward, trying to keep your distance from both Lengxings. One of them must be a ghost! Even the Lengxing who was with you looks completely shocked, staring at his double.\n\nThe second Lengxing, however, seems relieved. Smiling, he pulls out a piece of paper and walks toward you. The paper looks identical to the one the real Lengxing was using to record your discussion, filled with the same cramped handwriting.\n\nBefore you can react, a massive pale hand swoops down from the sky and grabs the second Lengxing, lifting him into the air as if he were nothing more than a doll. You stare in disbelief as the hand pulls him upwards, and you follow its path with your eyes.\n\nIt’s coming from the water tank.\n\nAnother hand, just as pale and grotesque, emerges from the tank, followed by the contorted body of a giant spectral woman. Her hair floats around her like a cloud, and her face is deathly pale. Her cold, dead eyes glare down at you, filled with malice.\n\nThe woman opens her mouth—an enormous, bloody maw stretching over two meters wide. You watch in horror as she lifts the second Lengxing into her mouth and starts chewing, the sound of bones crunching echoing in the silence. The sight is so horrifying that your mind can barely process it, and the terror leaves you frozen.\n\nIn his final moments, the second Lengxing manages to shout, 'Don’t run! Whatever you do, don’t split up!' These are his last words.\n\n'Someone screamed, 'Run!!!'' It's Yuqing Xie, and her cry shatters the spell holding everyone in place. In a blind panic, everyone bolts for the iron door, rushing down the stairwell as fast as they can.\n\nYou run, and run, your heart pounding in your chest. The fear drives you faster than you've ever moved before. You don’t care where you’re going; you just need to get away.\n\nSuddenly, you find yourself on the fifth floor. In front of you is the open door to Class 3.\n\n'No...No...please no...' you stammer, backing away. You hear the desperate screams of your classmates echoing through the stairwell. Your legs feel weak as you stumble backward, your foot catching on something soft.\n\nLooking down, you see a cardboard box. On it, written in large letters, is your name.\n\nScreaming in terror, you turn and run, but no matter how far you go, every time you glance behind you, the box is always just three steps away. You scream, begging, 'No! Please! Let me go! Please!' But there’s no escape.\n\nThe last time you look back, two pale hands reach out from the box, grab your legs, and pull you inside.\n\nThat is the last thing you see before everything goes black.",

The rooftop is vast, like a large playground, with faint outlines of solar panels, water tanks, and antennas barely visible through the mist. There's no safety fence, and one wrong step could send you plummeting into the void below.\n\nDespite the oppressive darkness, being outside feels safer than the unlit corridors below. But you know it's only an illusion of safety. The rooftop has only one exit: an iron door leading back to the stairwell. If that door gets blocked, there will be no escape.\n\nYou suddenly notice a group of people nearby, equally startled to see you and Yuqing Xie. It’s your classmates: Qingfeng Yao, Siqi Lv, Xuanxuan Li, Mu Bai, and the transfer student, Fuqing Huang. How did they all end up here? But despite the eerie circumstances, you feel a glimmer of relief. Seeing familiar faces in this terrifying situation is the best thing that could have happened.\n\nYou slowly approach them, still supporting Yuqing Xie, your body and mind completely exhausted from the horrifying events that led you here. Now, all seven students from Class 3 have gathered on the rooftop.\n\nShaken, you all find a place to sit. Qingfeng Yao mentions that he found a black phone when he arrived. Siqi Lv recognizes it as belonging to Mr. Li, your teacher. You suggest that everyone share their experiences to try to find some clues about the strange occurrences. Everyone agrees with your suggestion, and you take out a notebook and pen, starting to record the bizarre events you've all encountered.\n\nThe discussion lasts for about thirty minutes. During that time, you discover another identical black phone on the rooftop. The wallpaper, contacts, and everything else on both phones are the same—it's like a perfect copy. Both phones are smeared with traces of blood. After examining the phones, you find that both sent and received identical messages. One phone sent the message 'Come to the rooftop' to 'My Number,' and the other received the same message from 'My Number.'\n\nJust as you're trying to make sense of this, hurried footsteps echo from the stairwell again. Everyone freezes. Could there be more students trapped in the school? The iron door creaks open, and a figure steps through, causing everyone’s blood to run cold. It's you.\n\nHow can there be two of you? Everyone stands up in shock, instinctively backing away from you, their eyes filled with fear and suspicion. You feel just as confused, staring at this doppelgänger. The 'you' who entered through the iron door smiles and pulls out a piece of paper, walking toward the group. The paper looks identical to the notes you were just writing in.\n\nBefore anyone can react, a massive pale hand swoops down from above, grabbing the second 'you' like a doll. The giant hand lifts the imposter into the air as you and your classmates watch in horror. You trace the hand’s movement upward and see it belongs to a twisted, contorted figure rising from the water tank.\n\nAnother pale hand emerges from the tank, followed by a grotesque body with lifeless white eyes and long, flowing hair. The monstrous woman, impossibly large, looms over you all, her cold gaze filled with murderous intent. She opens her mouth—an enormous, blood-soaked maw stretching over two meters wide—and lowers the second 'you' into it. The chewing sounds echo across the rooftop, the sickening 'crunch' turning your stomach.\n\n'Run!!!' Yuqing Xie screams, breaking the silence. Panic surges through the group, and everyone scrambles to flee. You run, your mind clouded with terror, but a part of you remembers the imposter’s final words: 'Don’t run! Don’t split up!' But there’s no time to think. Staying here means certain death. You start running down the stairs, pushing your exhausted body to the limit. You quickly overtake Yuqing Xie, your stamina far better than hers.\n\nYou make it to the fifth floor and suddenly stop. Running further might not be the best idea. A smart predator doesn’t chase the fastest prey first—they go after the ones lagging behind. You notice an unlocked classroom door: Class 5. You remember that the lock on this door was broken. This could be your hiding spot.\n\nYou slip into the classroom and quietly close the door behind you. You hide near the window, where you’ll be out of sight unless someone enters the room. The faint sense of relief you feel is quickly shattered by the sound of distant screams. It’s Qingfeng Yao, followed by another scream—Siqi Lv. Your classmates are being hunted, and the killer is on the same floor.\n\nMinutes pass, and the silence returns. You wonder if your theory was correct. Maybe the ghostly woman is only after Class 3 students, and hiding in another classroom has put you out of her reach.\n\nYou sit quietly, thinking over the events. Everyone's strange experiences, the identical phones, and the doppelgänger—none of it makes sense. And then there’s that ominous message from 'My Number.' What does it all mean? You try to puzzle it out, but your thoughts are interrupted by a new sound: footsteps.\n\nYou peek through the window and see someone you didn’t expect. It's Siqi Lv. How is she still alive? You clearly heard her scream earlier. But something feels off about her; she seems too calm. After everything you've been through, how can she be so composed? You watch her walk toward Class 3’s room. A moment later, you see her run out, looking terrified, heading toward the rooftop.\n\nOne by one, you hear more footsteps. First Xuanxuan Li, then Mu Bai, then Fuqing Huang. They all seem to be heading for the rooftop too. And finally, you hear Yuqing Xie’s scream from downstairs. This is wrong. Something is very wrong.\n\nYou realize the truth: there’s a reason for the doppelgänger. The answer lies in the notebook. You start writing everything down, documenting your theory. Then you face a choice: try to escape, or take a risk and help everyone else. You’ve never seen yourself as a hero, but sometimes people are forced into that role.\n\nAfter writing your last note, you send a message from your phone: 'Go to the rooftop and meet up with everyone. Before that, go to the boys’ dormitory and find the nameless room. If you’re in danger, escape through the window, and whatever you do, stay together.'\n\nYou send the message to 'My Number.' If your theory is correct, the message will reach you in this twisted time and space.\n\nSuccess! But just as you begin to feel hope, you hear it—heavy breathing, followed by a voice muttering: 'Pull out the bones... Cut off the head... Grind the rest into meatballs...' Fear washes over you as you see a long-haired figure at the classroom door. You don’t wait—you run toward the rooftop, the monster’s footsteps echoing behind you. Bursting through the iron door, you finally reach the rooftop.\n\nThe others are already there—Qingfeng Yao, Siqi Lv, Xuanxuan Li, Mu Bai, Fuqing Huang, Yuqing Xie... and you. You smile, relieved to see them all again. But as you pull out the paper with your notes, a pale hand reaches down and grabs you. In the final moments, as you're lifted into the sky, you throw your phone down to the group. They’ll need it to understand the truth.\n\nWith your last breath, you scream: 'Don’t run! Don’t split up! If you leave the rooftop, you’ll die!' The monstrous woman opens her maw to devour you, and as you accept your fate, you mutter to yourself, 'Well, I guess I was a decent class president after all.'\n\nThis is the last thing you say before you die.",

            "Script": "Just as you were trying to find the root of this incident, you suddenly heard hurried footsteps in the corridor, which startled everyone. Could there be another student trapped in the school? With a creaking sound, the old iron door was pushed open, and a person rushed out, causing everyone's faces to turn pale as a sudden chill swept over you from head to toe. The person who came out of the door was Lengxing Ye!!!\nHow could there be two Lengxing Ye??? Everyone jumped up from the ground in fright and instinctively stepped back several paces, trying to stay as far away from the Lengxing Ye beside them as possible. One of these two must be a ghost in disguise!!! Even Lengxing Ye himself was dumbfounded as he stared at the version of himself who had just walked out of the iron door.\nThe Lengxing Ye who came out of the door looked at you with joy, holding a piece of paper filled with writing. Then, a large pale hand swept over your heads, and a mobile phone slipped through the fingers of that hand, falling into the Lengxing Ye beside you. Everyone stared in horror as that large hand slowly withdrew, and then the Lengxing Ye, who was caught by it, shouted with all his might: 'Don't run! Don't scatter! If you leave the rooftop, you will be killed!' Everyone, who was already preparing to flee, immediately stopped. Then, that Lengxing Ye was swallowed by the bloody jaws of a giant woman.\nWatching this scene, you were completely in despair. Facing such terror, almost no one believed they could survive. At that moment, the jade pendant hanging around Qingfeng Yao's neck began to emit a glow, enveloping all of you. Suddenly, the surrounding scenery started to change, and when you opened your eyes again, you found yourself in a space filled with white light, with nothing around you. You suddenly felt dizzy, followed by a splitting headache, and terrifying memories flooded your mind. You saw Lengxing Ye being eaten by the white-clad evil spirit — not once, but twice, and you hadn't remembered it at all before. You also saw yourself being torn apart by countless female ghosts in the dark corridor, which made you break into a cold sweat and gasp for air. What's going on? It felt like another person's memories had suddenly appeared in your mind. When you looked up, you saw that everyone else had the same expression, cold sweat dripping down their faces and terror in their eyes. The more timid ones were even trembling all over. What's going on?
