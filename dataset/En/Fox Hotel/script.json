            "Story": "You are Misaime, the Sky Dog guardian of Kyoto.\nDo you protect this land, or do you protect her?\n【The Meaning of Protection】\nLooking down at Kyoto from Mount Atago, it is still a vast area. The elders in your family say this is the place you have protected for generations. Although you don’t understand what this means, you are still striving to become a great Sky Dog for this vague mission.\nYour family is the Sky Dog clan responsible for protecting Kyoto, revered by the secular world. Since birth, you have lived on Mount Atago, where your family receives daily offerings from the mortal realm. Young Sky Dogs train in their respective branch dojos, hoping one day to go to the 【Tianyu Institute】 and become a great Sky Dog, a prominent figure.\nThe mission of the Sky Dog clan is to maintain peace in the Yokai realm and protect it as a whole. The clan is divided by strength into Sky Dogs, Crow Sky Dogs, Great Sky Dogs, and Nobles. After becoming a Great Sky Dog, you would serve at the Tianyu Institute, which is located in the heart of Kyoto and is responsible for maintaining stability in the mortal world and protecting Yokai from harm. Crow Sky Dogs assist the Great Sky Dogs, while Great Sky Dogs are the main executors. Nobles are the leaders of the Tianyu Institute, commanding all Great Sky Dogs and representing the pinnacle that every Great Sky Dog aspires to reach.\nYour father is one of the highest-ranking Nobles, and you were supposed to be the next Noble. However, you are a special case; you have been bullied by other Sky Dogs since childhood. Why? Because you are a half-breed of human and Sky Dog.\nThey would insult and beat you in front of others, calling you a bastard.\nFortunately, you have an older brother who has always supported and encouraged you. So you worked hard, trained diligently, and studied tirelessly, wanting to prove that you can also be a Noble Sky Dog!\nAlthough you are a half-human, through effort, you are the same as the other Sky Dogs, just like your brother and father. Additionally, you have a strange crescent-shaped birthmark with a circle on your right wing. You notice that your father has the same mark, but your brother does not. You happily believe this is a connection to your father’s bloodline, and you can certainly be as excellent as him.\nBut it seems some things are destined to be unchangeable, like talent. \"Misaime! Where are you daydreaming?!\" You hear a sharp scolding, startling you and making you grip the bamboo sword tighter.\nThe speaker is your brother, Misa Yamaki, the youngest in the family to become a Great Sky Dog. He is usually very kind to you, but he becomes strict during training. Your brother is an outstanding Sky Dog with great talent; he has already become a qualified Great Sky Dog at the Tianyu Institute. He didn’t work as hard as you, yet within a few years, he became a Great Sky Dog, while you, day and night, practice and learn, have only become an underachiever. After leaving the dojo, you walk to a grove on Mount Atago where you can see Kyoto. Elders have said Kyoto is the place you have protected for generations, but you don’t understand why it needs protection. Given your own struggles, isn’t it ridiculous to think about protecting others?\nYou begin to doubt, wondering if you are wrong. Perhaps hard work is futile; some things are decided from the moment you are born. Just as you start to think about giving up, your brother appears. He talks about his past, letting you know that he didn’t become a Great Sky Dog simply due to talent; he worked harder than those without talent. Your brother tells you: \"Keep going, Misaime. You can do it! As long as you work hard enough, you will definitely become a Noble.\"\nYou have been striving and believing. Believing that one day, you can stand with your brother and father, gaining the recognition of your clan and becoming a respected Noble. You vow silently.\nHowever, it seems the heavens did not hear your vow. After failing the Tianyu Institute’s tests several times, you had no choice but to intern under other Crow Sky Dogs, hoping to gain more experience for the next test.\nNot long into your internship, your father received a mysterious mission. You noticed that after receiving the task, he always seemed troubled, locking himself in his room. A couple of days later, he went out to execute the mission. You never imagined that would be the last time you saw your father. Later, you heard that a Snow Woman, responsible for suppressing Mount Fuji’s snow, suddenly disappeared from a village near Kyoto. Only a Sky Dog's feather was left at the scene. According to eyewitnesses, the abductor appeared to be a Sky Dog, and based on various descriptions, this kidnapper was your father!\nBut why did your father take the Snow Woman? Why didn’t he come home? Unfortunately, the organization had to list your father as the prime suspect, and you and your brother, as relatives, had to avoid involvement in the case and could only investigate privately, but with little success. You once investigated secretly and learned from your father's friend an astonishing truth: your father's mission was to eliminate the Snow Woman! You couldn’t understand how your father, who upheld justice and aimed to protect all beings in Kyoto, could do such a thing! Since then, you have never stopped searching for your father or that Snow Woman, but to little avail.During your time as an assistant Crow Sky Dog, you encountered many cases, but none you could handle. It wasn't just a lack of authority; it was your own inadequacy. This weighed heavily on your confidence. The inability to solve cases and your father’s disappearance made you consider giving up.\nOne day, while on duty, you overheard a discussion about a Fox Inn at the foot of Inari Mountain, rumored to grant wishes to those who find it. Feeling it might be an opportunity, you sought information and eventually discovered the inn!\nIt was a shaded mountain path, marked by a massive red torii at the entrance. As you walked along, you saw various sizes of torii gates and lifelike fox statues beneath them. At the end of the path, a silver-white fox sat waiting for you.\nFollowing the fox, you arrived at the inn, where the owner, Ayu, a stunning white nine-tailed fox, guided you on a tour. You felt inexplicably at home there. After sharing your reasons for visiting, Ayu took you to the shrine dedicated to Inari. You made a wish to succeed through hard work and to protect Kyoto’s justice and peace. Suddenly, the shrine glowed, revealing an omamori. You picked it up, but found it wouldn’t open. Unsure if your wish would come true, you kept the omamori with you.\nYou began visiting often to eat and drink. You noticed many Great Sky Dogs dining there, but they never paid, just keeping tabs, which troubled Ayu. You refused to partake in their behavior, choosing to sit at a small table and pay for your meals. Perhaps due to Inari’s influence, your wish actually came true—you soon passed the Crow Sky Dog evaluation. Elated, you returned to the inn to wish for success in solving cases as a Great Sky Dog.\nOver time, you grew close to Ayu, often drinking and sharing life’s troubles. Ayu revealed her past—she once had a betrothed, who was murdered on their wedding day. She only saw a kama-itachi that day, and later, she came to the Fox Inn. Ayu earnestly asked you to help investigate her fiancé's death, and you promised to uncover the truth.\nDuring your meals at the inn, you often heard a new chef, Fuyuki, ask guests if they liked his food. Initially, his cooking was average, but you admired his dedication. You believed he could become a good chef with enough practice. However, he didn’t seem to be overly friendly, appearing unfriendly towards all Great Sky Dogs, which puzzled you.\nSince you frequently visited the inn, you felt a divine energy uplifting your spirits. With newfound confidence, you returned to Kyoto and suddenly found solutions to piled-up cases. Your outstanding performance caught your superiors' attention, and you were unexpectedly promoted to Great Sky Dog! Your years of effort had paid off, though you still mourned your father’s absence.\nOn the day you became a Great Sky Dog, you excitedly sought your brother to share the news. However, he responded coldly, telling you it was impossible for you to become a Noble. That same day, Ayu held a celebration for your promotion, and everyone at the inn rejoiced in your achievement.\nYou cried that day. Afterward, you became increasingly reclusive, focusing intensely on investigations, hoping to uncover anything related to your father. You also dug into the kama-itachi case mentioned by Ayu, discovering it was linked to a local yokai organization, the 【Xinyuan Group】, whose leader, the Nopperabo, was a formidable figure with a strong reputation, making it difficult to confront him. The more engrossed you became in the cases, the more isolated you felt.\nOne day, while visiting the Fox Inn as usual, you ordered a bottle of sake. When it arrived, you saw the bottle and cup floating in mid-air! Curious, you approached, thinking it might be a new spell from Ayu, but found it was a tiny wooden puppet carrying the sake.If it can jump, it probably could only reach your knees.\nYou squatted down to take a closer look at the doll, which was exquisitely crafted. Suddenly, the little doll lifted her head to look at you blocking her way. You realized she wasn't just a doll, but a little doll monster. She strained to tiptoe, trying hard to pour you wine from a bottle that was her size, looking incredibly cute. You gently lifted her onto the table and softly said, Now you can pour the wine! She blushed, thanked you, and then dashed away like the wind.\nEvery day after that, when you visited the Fox Hotel for drinks, it was always the little doll who brought you wine. You gradually became familiar with her and learned her name was Yuko. She was always adorable, dressed in a pink bunny kimono, and wore a smile. One day, Yuko had a whimsical idea and wanted to compare heights with you. You were momentarily stunned, then stood up. She walked beside you, measuring her little short hands against your legs. Indeed, she still didn't reach your knees.\nShe tilted her head back and curiously asked, I wonder if the world you see, Tengu, is different from the one I see?\nYou smiled and reached out your hands to lift her, placing her on your shoulder and said, Now you can see the same as I do. \nAfter saying that, you spread your wings and flew up into the sky. You took Yuko away from the hotel, soaring through the clouds, bursting out of the mist into the sunny sky, overlooking the entire Inari Mountain. The green peaks were dotted with a few red torii gates, and the red rooftops of the nearby shrine formed a beautiful landscape. You asked Yuko if she liked the view, but she seemed scared, suddenly frozen and unable to speak! You quickly descended back to the hotel yard.\nYou anxiously set her down and asked if she was frightened and why she wasn't moving. She explained, lowering her head and quietly said, My spiritual power is too weak. Once I leave the hotel, I turn back into a doll that can't move or speak. However, even though I can't touch the cherry blossoms of spring, feel the summer streams, walk through autumn leaves, or step on the winter snow, just being able to see these beautiful sights makes me very happy. After all, before, even seeing them was a luxury. \nYou nodded thoughtfully, already having an idea in your mind. After returning, you gathered some pieces of cloth that you could find in your place, and with your clumsy skills, tried to sew them into a backpack. You thought it shouldn't be too stiff, so you added a lot of plush fabric inside, thinking of Yuko's cute appearance and her height, you made two holes at the level of her eyes. You sewed all night, and although it was still a bit crooked, you finally finished it! You thought about Yuko's usual likes and even added a cherry blossom pattern, but it still looked quite ugly...\nThe next day, when you returned to the hotel, you took out the cherry blossom-patterned backpack. A bit shyly, you said, Yuko, this is a backpack I made for you. I hope you can try lying inside. She opened the backpack and crawled in. Although it was sewn crookedly, it was just the right size.\nThen you closed the backpack and strapped it to your chest. You carefully took off and began to soar over the whole of Kyoto. You wanted her to see the brightly lit, peaceful Kyoto below and let her see what you had always protected.\nFrom then on, you often flew with Yuko in the cherry blossom backpack, taking her to see sights she had never seen before. Perhaps because she always stayed close to your heart, you gradually felt your heart getting closer to hers. You knew Yuko's wishes, so you would bring her many small gifts from outside—sometimes a cherry blossom, sometimes a maple leaf, and sometimes a pebble. Every time you saw Yuko jumping up happily when receiving gifts, you felt happy too.\n**[Everyone at the Hotel]**\nYou, along with Sister Ayu, Kazutora, and Yuko, were growing more and more like a family. Through Yuko, you learned that Kazutora seemed to have a crush on Sister Ayu, and you also realized that the hotel was what Yuko wanted to protect. Gradually, the hotel felt more like home to you. After all, compared to your missing father, deceased mother, and indifferent brother, this place felt warmer, happier, and filled with people you liked.\nRecently, a new member joined the hotel. It was a small red fox, not much taller than Yuko, fluffy and lively. This little fox was like a small sun, always cheerful. When she saw you, she smiled and introduced herself: I'm called Xiao Nuan! I'm here to be an apprentice shrine maid, please take care of me! She offered you a bucket of cookies, asking if you wanted to try some paw-shaped cookies. You took a piece and felt a wave of warmth from within. However, Yuko didn't seem to like this little fox much, saying during your playtime that ever since the fox arrived, she had been sharing a room with her.She appeared so suddenly, coming to the hotel with ulterior motives and other intentions! You are not very close to Xiao Nuan because of Yuko. In the days that followed, Yuko couldn't stop talking about Xiao Nuan. However, her tone gradually changed. She would happily tell you how Xiao Nuan snuggled up on her little bed every night to talk about the outside world, sharing many novel and interesting things, saying that Xiao Nuan's fur was very soft and warm, and that Xiao Nuan worked very hard, completing every task that Sister A Yu assigned her exceptionally well. You know, Yuko has already accepted Xiao Nuan as part of the Fox Hotel family in her heart. You also take on the role of an older brother, occasionally bringing gifts for Yuko but also for Xiao Nuan as a reward for sharing her paw biscuits. You treat Xiao Nuan like a brother treats a sister; after all, you have never had a sister, so you pamper her a lot. Of course, in your heart, the most important one is still the adorable Yuko.\nOccasionally, you also see that long-headed monster in the hotel; he is the boss of the New Garden Group, known as Nopperabo. It is said that he often comes here to eat and drink for free, claiming to protect this place. What’s the difference between this behavior and extorting protection fees? You really dislike this self-proclaimed monster boss; to you, he is just a thug in the underworld. What right does such a monster have to talk about protection? He only causes trouble. However, recently you heard Yuko say that he brought a very strange snow woman to stay in the hotel. It is said that this snow woman has a cloud of darkness on her head, making her look very unhappy. You really want to find this snow woman to ask about the Thunder Woman of Mount Fuji. Since they are both from the snow woman clan, she should know something, right? But Yuko said that this snow woman sealed her door with ice as soon as she moved in, not allowing anyone in. Yuko could only leave the food at the door when delivering meals. You have indeed never seen her come out, so you have never had the chance to ask her.\nEvery week on the hotel’s rest day, you go to the hotel to play with Yuko. Everyone  You don’t like playing cards, but Yuko loves it, so every time you just watch her play.\nIn the Monster Cards, there are shadows of small monsters sealed within, each card having different attributes. If the card's attribute matches yours, you can connect with the monster in the card, activate same-attribute cards, and even cast a little prank spell on the next player. You are a Sky Dog, a wind attribute monster, able to activate the Yamawaro card. Yuko is a puppet doll; although she is a wood attribute monster, there are no wood attribute cards, so she can only activate the earth attribute Yamawaro card a little. However, she doesn’t cast any prank spells; after all, she just needs to be cute.\n[The Mission of Justice]\nRecently, you received a case. The renowned craftsman Master Spider mysteriously died in his Baibao Glass Workshop. After receiving the report, you immediately rushed to the workshop. After examining it, you didn’t find any special clues; however, after investigating Master Spider's relationships, you unexpectedly discovered that the last person he contacted was Sister A Yu!\nAlthough Sister A Yu is the prime suspect, fortunately, the preliminary time of death matched her alibi, so she should not be the murderer. Otherwise, you really wouldn’t know what to do since she was there with Yuko that day.\nMoreover, there is another suspicious person! The boss of the New Garden Group, Nopperabo. When you were investigating that day, he insisted on barging in with his subordinates. If you hadn’t stopped him, he would have likely ruined the scene. Nopperabo must be involved in this matter. You two had an argument that day, and he stormed off with his subordinates. But you began to suspect that the spider elder might have known something and was silenced.\nAlthough this case has not yet concluded, it hasn’t affected you too much. You brought the spider elder's body back to Tianyi Court and handed it over to your colleagues for autopsy. By chance, you overheard your colleagues chatting. They said that the main deity of the Kyoto area, Lord Inari, would be descending from the divine realm soon to personally select a new divine servant. Moreover, Lord Inari would grant one wish to the new servant! This means that if you can become the new divine servant, you could ask Lord Inari for the freedom that Yuko desires! Although you don’t know what the conditions for being chosen as a divine servant are, you are determined to strive for this opportunity!\nYou hurriedly flew to the hotel to tell Yuko this good news. However, from the sky, you spotted a wolf demon lying at the back door of the hotel. You immediately flew down to check the situation and discovered that the wolf demon had died from excessive blood loss.\nUpon inspecting the wolf demon's body, you initially concluded that the cause of death was a stab wound to the chest, with the weapon likely being a double-edged blade about three inches long, and the wound being an upward cut.\nIf time permits, you are sure you could find the murderer. The general direction is already clear, or you could report the case to the court and initiate an investigation. This is indeed the duty of a Sky Dog. However, when you picked up the long-distance communication device to call your superiors, you hesitated. In a couple of days, Lord Inari would come to the Fox Hotel. If a murder case broke out at that time, the hotel would certainly be temporarily sealed. If Lord Inari didn’t come because of that, helping Yuko achieve her freedom would be impossible. Moreover, this is the hotel that Yuko wants to protect; she definitely wouldn’t want something like this to happen.\nYou put down the communication device, dragged the body to a pile of stones by the lake to hide it, and then saved the information and clues you had gathered on the special app for case investigation used by the Sky Dog at Tianyi Court, Monster Encyclopedia, deciding to conduct a detailed investigation after the selection event ends.",
            "Script": "【Morning Sunshine】\nYou woke up early today. Before dawn, you arrived at the hotel. The hotel is very quiet in the morning; it seems that everyone is still asleep. You quietly walk to the hall and find that the usually lively hall is silent, which has its own elegance.\nAfter arriving at the hall, you notice a brand new set of monster cards on the table. You remember hearing that Inari-sama enjoys playing monster cards, so you quickly brushed up on the rules to increase your chances of winning. You pick up the deck, take a look, and then sort it into 8 piles according to the rules. Just as you're about to simulate a game, Sister Ayu and Kazuki arrive at the hall together. Seeing them, you stop moving the cards, keeping them in the sorted state, thinking that you'll deal the cards soon anyway. After a while, a somewhat unfamiliar figure enters the hall—it's the Snow Woman. You've heard Yuko mention this strange Snow Woman, but for some reason, she sits right next to you. You glance at her and suddenly recall your father and the Snow Woman's disappearance case, thinking that you finally have a chance to ask her. Just as you’re about to speak, that annoying Nopperabo walks in. He greets everyone, glances at you, and then sits on your other side. No one speaks, and the entire hall is eerily quiet. The sorted monster cards are on the table, but no one seems eager to start. Suddenly, you hear a sound of running, and you see the red Xiao Nuan dragging Yuko towards you. The moment you see Yuko, you want to greet her and pat her little head. However, she glances at you and sits down opposite you, momentarily speechless.\n",

You said you would protect Kyoto, but now you've failed to protect even the most important deity.\nListening to what the divine messenger said, this hotel must be destroyed. In Yuko's eyes, you saw despair and heartbreak. Yes, this is the place Yuko tried so hard to protect; it holds her family. It is also your family.\nWhat will you protect now?\nYuko. You must protect Yuko well. You must help her safeguard the hotel; it is her home. Yuko only has you. Be her support, be her strength.\nYuko, the Fox Hotel, and the safety of all Kyoto depend on you, Misaime!\n",

            "Story": "You have long forgotten your name, as everyone refers to you as [Master Nopperabo].\nCountless youkai surround you, yet you remain lonely until you found that place.\n[The Loneliness of Youth]\nIn a slum near Kyoto is where your memories began. The youkai living here are those who refuse to integrate into human society and resent humans. These youkai, due to their hostility towards humans, have been driven to this sunless, dilapidated alley by the Tengu of the Kyoto enforcement organization - [Tenmiin]. Neighbors say you were abandoned in this alley; the woman who left you seemed to be chased by someone and hid you in a garbage bin before running away. You were raised by kind neighbors who fed you bit by bit. Growing up, you were safe, but what future does a child fed by many families have? As you grew, you felt too ashamed to beg for food from neighbors. Life in the slum is tough for everyone. To survive, you learned to steal. Initially, it was just food, but later it escalated to valuables. Until one time, you were caught stealing. Unfortunately, the person you stole from was the local thug leader. He caught you and was about to beat you senseless. With no other choice, you had to fight back. To your surprise, you discovered you had a natural talent for combat. That little youkai couldn't defeat you and ran away in anger.\nAfter that, you stopped sneaking around and started robbing openly, specifically targeting thugs, relying on your reckless determination and innate combat skills. It wasn’t long before you became the boss of the slum. You supported your neighbors and took care of orphans like yourself. Life felt fulfilling. However, those who once nurtured you became polite and fearful of you. As you grew older, you were unwilling to remain in this slum. You had bigger goals; you wanted to go to Kyoto. You wished to provide a good living environment for these youkai and to let them be close to you as they were in your childhood. You heard of an organization in Kyoto called [Shinyuan Group] that would accept anyone capable and give them a chance. Thus, you planned to venture to Kyoto to seek this organization.\nThough you were full of passion, no one recommended you. You couldn’t find a way to enter [Shinyuan Group]. One day, you learned about a fox inn located in the deep mountains next to the Inari Shrine in Kyoto, where the Inari God is worshipped by youkai. If you prayed earnestly, your wish could come true. So, with a hopeful mindset, you arrived at the inn. You prayed to the Inari God: to successfully find and join [Shinyuan Group] and to establish your own place in the organization. After your wish, the shrine suddenly glowed, and a talisman appeared before you. You picked up the talisman and tried to open it but found it impossible. You weren’t sure if your wish would come true, but you kept the talisman with you. The innkeeper was a white nine-tailed fox. Hearing your prayer, she mentioned that she knew someone who could recommend you to join the organization. You were overjoyed and thanked the innkeeper, then followed the address she provided to find the organization. After demonstrating your combat talent and strength, you successfully became a member of the organization.\nAlthough you were just a small fry, your hard work and strong foundation helped you rise through the ranks. One day, the organization leader personally summoned you to see the shining new star of the organization. You were ecstatic; this was the opportunity you had been waiting for! But when you met the leader, both of you were stunned. You discovered that the leader of [Shinyuan Group] was also a Nopperabo! Because youkai like Nopperabo are rare in the youkai world, the leader must be cut out for leadership. The leader inquired about your background, and you shared your past in the slum.\nAfter listening, the leader was extremely excited. He descended from his high position and examined you closely for a long time, then glanced at your wrist. There, you had a small red birthmark from birth. Upon seeing the birthmark, he hugged you with tears in his eyes, saying, \"My son, it’s my failure as a father that made you suffer so much...\" You were stunned; you never imagined that the leader of all youkai in Kyoto was your father. He explained that shortly after your mother gave birth to you, you both were kidnapped by enemies during an outing, and since then, there had been no news of you. He spent most of his life searching for you in vain.\nAfterward, you stayed by your father’s side as his right-hand man. Not long after, your father told you that he was getting old and, seeing how exceptional his son was, decided to pass the position of [Shinyuan Group] leader to you. He would retire to focus on finding your mother. Thus, you became the leader of all youkai in Kyoto, maintaining peace in the youkai realm.\n[The Loneliness of Youth]\nSoon after your father retired, he went out and rarely contacted you. You bought a large courtyard in Kyoto and brought all your former neighbors and brothers to live together. You achieved your initial goal. Everyone lived joyfully here, drinking and playing cards, truly happy.、But you can never regain that feeling from back then; you only feel your position rising higher and higher, putting you further away from them. They used to call you [Little Nopperabo], but now, regardless of age, even your aunt who raised you for so long greets you with a bow, referring to you as [Master Nopperabo]. You know you can never return to those youthful days.\nUnder your organization, there are several departments, including an assassination division. Most of the assassins there are Kama-itachi, and the most formidable assassin is one named Fuutarou, the most skilled killer in all of Kyoto, who has never failed a mission. Since you are of a similar age, you share a good relationship that surpasses the typical superior-subordinate dynamic, more like brothers. You know he doesn’t particularly enjoy killing; his hobby, as Kyoto's top assassin, is cooking. He is indeed quite talented in the kitchen, to the extent that even his wife fell for him because of his culinary skills.\nOne day, one of your subordinates in charge of intelligence reported that trouble might be brewing near Kyoto. Two fox demon villages were involved in a conflict, and one village's chief had even hired an assassin to kill the elder's son from the rival village. As the leader responsible for maintaining stability in the youkai world, you couldn’t allow such a thing to happen; you feared it could spark a war between the two fox villages. So you sent Fuutarou to protect the elder's son from the fox village. Before he left, Fuutarou hesitated, and you knew his wife was newly pregnant. So you reassured him, promising that when he returned, you would give him a long vacation to spend with his wife.\nHowever, a whole month passed without any sign of Fuutarou. Worried that something might have happened to him, you sent someone to investigate. The scout returned with the grim news that the elder's son from the fox village had been killed, and Fuutarou was missing. However, no war broke out between the two fox villages. You dispatched many to search for him, but even his wife was nowhere to be found. In his house, you only discovered a note that read:\n\"Boss, regardless of whether this mission succeeded or not, I’m retiring. I’m sorry, Boss. I can’t fight by your side anymore. Please forgive me.\" \nUpon reading the note, you suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness. The one brother who fought beside you, whom you could call your own, was gone. You were alone again.\n[The Loneliness of Drowning]\nAfter making your wish, you frequently visited the fox inn to eat. You promised the innkeeper that you would protect the inn's safety using your position as the leader, and thus you never paid for meals, boldly enjoying free food and drink. The former innkeeper had been promoted to the divine realm to serve as a deity's envoy, and the current innkeeper is a new nine-tailed fox named Ayu. You watched Ayu grow from a maid in the inn to the innkeeper, so your feelings for her are even deeper; she feels like a little sister to you. Even now, when you often come to mooch off meals, Ayu just playfully scolds you but sets the chopsticks down for you.\nRecently, you heard that the Snow Woman from Mount Fuji has gone missing. Mount Fuji, located near Kyoto, is actually an active volcano, and the Snow Woman residing there has been using heavy snow to seal the volcano and prevent it from erupting, which would threaten Kyoto. The Snow Woman clan is under a curse; they can never encounter someone truly sincere towards them, or they will only suffer. This is necessary for the Snow Woman's power to grow stronger and the snow to be enough to seal the volcano. As the leader of the youkai world, you understand the seriousness of this matter and immediately set off to Mount Fuji to investigate.\nOn your way to Mount Fuji, you saw a little Snow Woman, her head covered in dark clouds, kicking stones and muttering, \"Kill all the men in the world.\" Upon seeing her, you understood that this little Snow Woman had also been hurt and was deceived by some man. You certainly couldn’t let her kill all men, as you didn’t want to provoke a war between youkai and humans. Seeing this dangerous little Snow Woman, you decided to help her disperse the clouds and untangle her knots. You sensed a similar aura in her, a feeling of drowning loneliness. You thought to yourself that you couldn’t save yourself, but you wanted to help this little Snow Woman. Perhaps this is what it means to empathize with each other's suffering.\nYou approached and asked, \"Are you the Snow Woman from Mount Fuji?\" She looked at you coldly and replied, \"That’s my mother. She’s gone missing. I came down the mountain to find her.\" After hearing this, you extended a hand to her, saying, \"I’m the leader of the youkai in Kyoto, Master Nopperabo! I’ve come to investigate the disappearance of the Snow Woman from Mount Fuji. Since she’s your mother, would you be willing to help me investigate?\" After a moment of hesitation, she nodded slightly but didn’t acknowledge your outstretched hand, simply saying that she had learned from her investigation that the one who kidnapped her mother was a youkai with black wings and a crescent moon on them, with a circular birthmark.\nYou awkwardly withdrew your hand and continued, \"How can it still be snow-covered on Mount Fuji if the Snow Woman is missing? It seems this little Snow Woman has quite powerful abilities!\" As you looked at the clouds above her head, you attempted to push them away. However, as soon as your hand touched a corner, it was frozen back. \"What is this? Can those things on your head dissipate?\" she coldly answered while walking forward, \"No.\" You chased after her, asking, \"Then can you be happier?\" She glanced at you and said, \"No!\" \"Can you at least smile?\" \"No!\"\nYou awkwardly cleared your throat and continued, \"Alright! But you must stick close to me! We’re going to Kyoto; that's my territory, filled with my brothers. If you fall behind and get bullied, I won’t help you!\" She looked at you, both angry and amused. After saying goodbye, she turned back to Mount Fuji and descended, leaving behind snow that wouldn’t melt for two years. Once she came down, you both set off on your journey to Kyoto.On the way, you kept watching the dark cloud on her head, asking, \"How did your cloud form? Can it dissipate? Can you be a bit happier? Can you smile?\" But she ignored you. Finally, you arrived in Kyoto and took her to a large courtyard, letting her stay there. The youkai in your courtyard had never seen you get so close to any female youkai, and they cheered and teased you. You didn't bother to explain, just asked them to play with Yukihime more since she was feeling down. However, after many days, while sunbathing on a tree in the courtyard, you noticed everyone was drinking and playing cards, laughing joyfully, while she drifted like a ghost, the dark cloud still looming over her. It seemed the cloud had grown denser, making you feel helpless but also more determined to help her.\nOne day, you noticed a Kama-itachi at the entrance of the organization, striking a whirlwind blade pose. You remembered the whirlwind blade was a unique skill of Kazutarou. Thinking it was Kazutarou returning, you excitedly shouted his name. But when the Kama-itachi turned, you realized he looked similar to Kazutarou but was much younger. You hurriedly asked who he was, and he replied, \"I’m Kazueichi, wanting to join here as a killer.\" You asked if he knew Kazutarou, and he was surprised, saying that Kazutarou was his father.\nYou inquired about Kazutarou's whereabouts, and he said his father opened a restaurant in their hometown, spending his days peeling potatoes in the kitchen. The others in the village were professional killers, but his father only taught him to cook. Upon hearing this, you suddenly understood Kazutarou’s decision to leave. You comprehended his choices and sacrifices. You told the young man about his father's glorious deeds, emphasizing the courage it took for his father to make such choices. The boy seemed shocked, unable to believe that his father was once Kyoto's top killer. You said, \"Since you want to be a killer, stay here.\" He hesitated for a moment, then said, \"Maybe being a cook isn’t so bad after all.\" After saying that, he bid you farewell and left. You thought this boy had a bit of Kazutarou’s spirit.\nBut what you didn’t expect was that later, when you went to the Fox Hotel for a meal, you saw this boy working as a cook there. He was surprised to see you, but Ayu seemed unfazed, saying, \"Come try my new cook's skills.\" You sampled the food and felt a bit disappointed. His skills truly didn’t measure up to Kazutarou's craftsmanship; the knife skills were decent, but that was all. So you smiled at Kazueichi in the kitchen, saying, \"Young man, the road ahead is long. Do you think being a cook is easy? Hahaha. Keep working hard!\" But since he was your brother's son, you felt responsible and started visiting the Fox Hotel more frequently, under the pretext of checking his progress.\nThe Fox Hotel felt different to you. Here, you were no longer the high-ranking leader of the youkai world but rather a brother, an elder. You could briefly forget that feeling of loneliness. Suddenly, you remembered another person, the lonely Snow Woman, and thought, if you brought her to stay here, would she be a bit happier?\nYou hurried back to Yukihime and said, \"I’ll take you to Inari Shrine to make a wish. It will help you relax.\" She coldly replied, \"I don’t want to go.\" You pondered how to trick her into going. After all, you had previously informed her that the youkai with black wings were the Tengu. So you added, \"There’s a fox inn next to Inari Shrine. Many Tengu are there. You might be able to meet the Tengu who took your mother.\" Upon hearing that she might find her mother, she immediately agreed. You arrived at the Fox Hotel, and Ayu arranged for her to stay in a room in the backyard. You took her to the shrine to make a wish, saying the wishes there were powerful. With a reluctant expression, she made her prayer. However, right after praying, she returned to her room, sealing all the doors and windows with ice, not allowing anyone in or out.\nThe Fox Hotel had a maid named Yuko, a doll-like figure just a few dozen centimeters tall, who could only reach your knee when she jumped. You found her quite adorable and often played with her, but she didn’t seem to like you much and wasn’t very close to you. Recently, a new red fox named Xiao Nuan arrived, who loved a type of paw-shaped cookie. Every time she saw you, she offered you cookies. Watching her was like seeing your little daughter, both cute and warm. You often took her out to play, flying kites, picking flowers, and catching bugs, having a great time together. You also frequently brought her little gifts and tasty treats.\nLooking at the innocent and kind Xiao Nuan, you suddenly thought of Yukihime. You wondered if Xiao Nuan could warm her heart. So you solemnly asked Xiao Nuan to deliver cookies to the Snow Woman, saying she was very lonely. Xiao Nuan nodded thoughtfully, saying, \"Uncle Nopperabo, I will definitely do what you asked!\" You hoped Xiao Nuan could bring warmth to Yukihime, and you would do your best too.\nYou had a close friend named Old Spider, who ran a treasure glass shop in the mortal realm. He was the only friend with whom you had a heart-to-heart over the years. He personally crafted a razor-sharp famous sword for you, called Onimaru, which became your favorite weapon. Whenever you had the chance, you would go visit Old Spider to play chess, drink, and talk about everything.Recently, the leader of the wolf youkai clan came to find you, saying he had urgent news. Although the wolf youkai clan is very loyal and powerful, their intelligence is low, which troubles you as their leader. They always come to you for decisions on matters big and small. This little wolf nervously reported that their treasured [You珠] had been stolen. The jewel contains the purest wolf clan youkai power and is the treasure that protects the entire wolf youkai clan. However, a thief had stolen it two days ago. After thinking it over, you decided this matter shouldn't be made public; if other clans learned of it, they might take the opportunity to trouble the wolf youkai clan. So you ordered the little wolf who reported this to track down the thief. The little wolf took the command seriously and went off, and you kept this matter in mind.[The Antidote to Loneliness]Recently, a Tengu came to you. You have always disliked Tengus, but this one was different; he claimed to be the son of the current daimyo and the most likely candidate to become the next daimyo. He also disliked some of his father's ways and wanted to cooperate with you. He had a younger brother who was rising rapidly and might threaten his position. He hoped you could help him eliminate his brother. You learned from him that his brother had a birthmark on his feathers, and the description matched the Tengu who had kidnapped Snow Maiden’s mother, so you kept this matter in mind.Not long ago, one of your subordinates reported that the Spider Elder from the Eight Treasures Glass Shop had been murdered. You were eager to check the situation, but a Tengu blocked your way at the door. You noticed that he had the same birthmark on his wings. You told him you were the boss of the Kyoto youkai world and wanted to pay your last respects to a friend; why shouldn't you be allowed in? He replied that you were just a thug and claimed he was the police officer responsible for this case, forbidding you from entering and disturbing the crime scene. You harbored resentment towards him and secretly sent someone to investigate. Your subordinate informed you that the last person to see the Spider Elder was Ah Yu from the Fox Hotel. You trusted Ah Yu, but the Spider Elder was also an important friend. After much deliberation, you decided to send a little wolf from the wolf clan to investigate what happened when Ah Yu last saw the Elder.You went to visit Snow Maiden as usual. You noticed that the dark clouds above her head had recently lessened. The little snow girl told you she had found news about her mother. It was said that her mother had gone mad and had frozen several villages around Mount Fuji. The Tenmiin sent a Tengu with a birthmark to eliminate the snow girl, and that Tengu often visited the Fox Hotel, even getting close to the doll, Yuko. Snow Maiden seemed to have just cried and said, choked with emotion, that she had to kill this Tengu to avenge her mother. You looked at her seriously and asked, Will killing him make the clouds above your head disappear? She nodded tearfully, and you continued, Then will you feel happier? She cried, Yes. You looked at her firmly and said, Then I will help you. Let’s kill this Tengu together!But how could you kill him? Snow Maiden suggested that everyone often plays youkai cards at the inn, and since the Tengu never participates, he would likely be a novice at it, which could be a point to exploit. You told Snow Maiden that a few days ago, you heard Xiao Nuan mumble that soon the Inari God would come to the Fox Hotel to choose a new divine messenger to serve him. Everyone could gather for a card game at that time, and it would be an excellent opportunity to act.You often played youkai cards. This was the favorite card game among the youkai in your courtyard. Each card contained the shadow of a cute little youkai, and every card had different attributes. If the card's attribute matched your own, you could establish a connection with it, enabling you to manipulate cards of the same attribute and even release minor charms to play pranks on everyone. Through the youkai cards, you learned that they were quite profound. Although there are only five types of youkai attributes, these cards possess real spiritual power. Youkai can manipulate cards with attributes similar to theirs. For example, as a Nopperabo, a thunder attribute youkai, you could manipulate thunder attribute cards like Chizume. You had never lost a game of youkai cards because the Nopperabo clan's innate leadership abilities made all the youkai in the card game obey your commands, allowing you to control all the cards and cast spells among them.After Snow Maiden finished speaking, you looked at her and seriously said, You never go out and usually don’t play cards. You don’t even know how to play, right? How about this: you learn from me. I've never lost a game of youkai cards! Snow Maiden thought for a moment, then used her magic to create a little snowman. She placed it in your sleeve; through this little snowman, she learned to play youkai cards with you. You had never lost, but the snowman would melt, and each time it could only learn for two rounds. After two rounds, you would bang the table and say, No more, no more! You guys are so weak; go practice more before coming back to play with me!Weeks went by, and you felt Snow Maiden had learned enough. One evening, you went to find her and said, Tomorrow is the day the Inari God arrives. Are you ready? The snow girl silently replied, I've been ready for a long time.",
            "Script": "[Morning Sunshine]\nToday, you got up early. You quietly ran to the outside of Yuki's room. Through the frozen window, you watched her inside. When no one was around, she seemed relaxed. Lazily combing her long hair, you saw her tidy up and leave her room. You hesitated at the door for a moment, then stepped into the hall.\nOnce in the hall, you noticed everyone was already seated. There were youkai cards on the table, looking shuffled and ready, but no one seemed inclined to play. You felt the atmosphere was a bit too tense, so you joked and greeted everyone. Then you glanced at Yuki. Just as you planned, she sat next to the Sky Dog. You also casually took a seat on the other side, placing the Sky Dog between you two. This was your agreed plan. After a while, the fiery little Ao dragged the doll Yuko in. Everyone sat silently for a moment.\n",

After all, the Inari God is the main deity of the Kyoto area, and this matter cannot end well.\nThe key issue now is that the Snow Woman has become the prime suspect. She was the last person to deal cards to the deity, and you did indeed have a plan to manipulate the cards. You’re uncertain if the Inari God’s death is connected to you two. However, you know you placed a demon-slaying curse in all your cards. You initially planned to guess the cards and withdraw the card for the Sky Dog, which would have taken his life immediately. But you guessed wrong. You never had the chance to pass him a card. You didn’t want to hurt Xiao Nuan, so you gave the Sky Dog’s card, which had no curse, to her. So, the Inari God’s death is not your responsibility.\nBut what about the Snow Woman? You promised to help her dispel the clouds and make her happy, but in this situation, protecting her has become extremely difficult. Yet even so, will you really just ignore this poor little thing?\nMoreover, those two messengers just mentioned that this inn must be destroyed. But this is your only refuge from loneliness. You’ve been enjoying free food and drink for so long, and you promised that if anything happened to the inn, you would protect everyone.\nYou are the leader of all youkai in Kyoto.

        "Nine-Tailed Fox": {
            "Story": "You are A Yu, the landlady of the Fox Hotel\n——Clearly, it is the place that has trapped you. Yet you find it harder and harder to leave.\n【Genuine Love】\nYou are a white nine-tailed fox, born in a mountain village far from Kyoto. Your village is filled with white foxes, and you are the most beautiful little fox in the village. Your best friend, who grew up with you, is named A Hu. He is the son of the clan leader, and your parents have always thought you would be well-suited together. You both have an unspoken understanding about this.\nPerhaps because you yearn for a lively life, you have always envied families with siblings. You love children and often run out to play with the little foxes in the village. You have always looked forward to growing up quickly, marrying A Hu, and having a cute little fox of your own. However, foxes take a long time to get pregnant, so you privately approached A Hu to discuss getting engaged as soon as possible. Or perhaps indulging in forbidden fruit before marriage, so that after the wedding, you could quickly have your own baby. A Hu naturally agreed. Taking advantage of your parents being away visiting relatives, you both indulged in each other. Soon, you felt something different in your body, and from observing the other fox aunties in the village, you secretly rejoiced that you might be pregnant with a little fox. You felt the little heartbeat in your belly every day, thinking about soon having your own baby, and lived each day happily.\nYou scheduled your wedding date as planned, and the engagement day finally arrived. You were on your way to A Hu's house for the engagement banquet when you caught a glimpse of a scarred fox, Kama, flashing by. You wondered how, after being in the village for so long, you had never seen a fox of a different color. Moreover, it was headed towards A Hu's house. You rushed over only to find A Hu's parents kneeling on the ground, crying, while A Hu lay in a pool of blood.\nThe sudden disaster left you in despair. You returned home and locked yourself in for three days and nights. Your father worriedly spoke to you through the door, saying, 'Maybe you should just terminate the pregnancy. A Hu is gone; it’s fortunate you weren’t married. Let’s keep this quiet; we won't say anything, and there will be other opportunities later.' You cried until your voice was hoarse, using all your strength to tell your father outside the door, 'No! I will give birth to my child. A Hu and I have been childhood sweethearts for so many years; I can't do something so heartless and ungrateful!' Your parents couldn't persuade you otherwise and had to agree. A few years later, you gave birth to a super cute, soft, white little fox, whom you named Xiao Bai. Xiao Bai was obedient and sensible from a young age. You thought to yourself that you would accompany your daughter as she grew up, living a simple life together with your parents, and that would be happiness enough.\nYou know your fox village has a mission. In Kyoto, there is a main god, the Inari God. Legend has it that his former self was rice, as people sincerely prayed to the rice they planted, hoping for a good harvest the following year. This power nourished a creature called the Rice Demon, but they are benevolent. As people's wishes grew stronger and their hearts more sincere, they gradually regarded rice as a belief, and this collective faith turned the Rice Demon into a god, who became the Inari God and later moved to the divine realm.\nThe Inari God is the main deity worshipped in the Kyoto area. He has a unique trait; he is said to be amiable and approachable, but requires many attendants to serve him. Due to his association with rice, he is plump, with a round belly and a round face, and he loves fluffy animals. Therefore, his attendants are all foxes and raccoons.\nBecause of this, all foxes in the Kyoto area, whether from villages or families, aspire to become messengers of the Inari God. For all foxes, this is a glorious and great task. Once you become a messenger of the god and enter the divine realm to live, you can leap from being a demon to a god! Your village serves as the 'Fan Fan Messenger' for the Inari God. You had once fantasized about being chosen as a messenger. You practiced for a long time as a child, but now that you have a child, you no longer train.\nWhen Xiao Bai was about a year old, a messenger arrived in the village to select the next candidate for the Fan Fan Messenger. The chosen candidates would go to Kyoto to a place called the Fox Hotel for training. You didn’t want to go; you now had Xiao Bai and only wanted to live with her. But unexpectedly, you were chosen. Perhaps it was because you were the most beautiful and had the shiniest fur. You really didn’t want to go and could only discuss with the village chief: 'Can I not go? I need to raise my daughter; she is still so young. What will happen to her without her mother?' The village chief sternly told you, 'If you anger the messenger and make the Inari God unhappy, what if the harvest next year fails? Will you take responsibility for the village starving? This is a glorious matter; how can you refuse? Do you want your parents and the entire village to starve? If you're worried about this child, we can take care of her. We don't mind at all.' Hearing such deceptive and threatening words, you realized you had no choice but to go.\nHowever, you were truly worried about Xiao Bai and pleaded with the messenger to allow you to bring her along. The messenger laughed and said, 'What are you thinking? Do you want to be a messenger while dragging your family along?' You then pleaded again, 'Can I come back often to see her?' The messenger replied, 'Stop negotiating conditions with me. Unless you become a messenger of the god, you can do whatever you want. During the training process, you just have to stay obediently in the hotel. You can't go anywhere!' You continued to ask if you could occasionally return to see her. Even this last request was denied. With no choice, you could only set off for the Fox Hotel alone.\n【Aiming for Improvement】\nUpon arriving at the Fox Hotel, you learned about the training methods for the Fan Fan Messenger. You needed to start from the most basic level as a maid. Every day, your training involved cleaning, receiving guests, serving food and drinks, etc. If you performed well, you could become the landlady. Once you became the landlady, the Inari God would personally come to the hotel to check on your training results, and only if you were qualified would you be chosen to become a messenger of the god. So you worked hard, cleaning ten times more than others. You feared that if you couldn't become a messenger, you'd have to stay here forever for training, so you worked extremely hard.\nThe former landlady was also a nine-tailed fox. She looked at you with great satisfaction and gently said, 'A Yu, I believe that you will be my successor in the future. I will cultivate you well.' She treated you especially kindly. A long-headed monster often came to the hotel for a meal; everyone called him the 'Nopperabo Lord.' He would arrogantly tell the landlady, 'Landlady, if you ever need anything, just find me. I'm the boss in Kyoto, right? I’ll take care of everything for you. I won’t be polite this meal!' The landlady would always smile and serve him with chopsticks, softly saying, 'Lord, eat up!' But every time you looked at him, you were curious why he didn't pay for his meals. However, he was quite nice to you, often asking, 'Little A Yu, have you been working hard today? Look, I brought you some candy from outside; you should eat it!' Even though you were already a mother, in the eyes of Nopperabo Lord, you would always be a child.\nGradually, you realized that he wasn’t such a bad person after all. Every time you saw him, you would call him 'Nopperabo Brother,' and your relationship remained very good. Later, the landlady was chosen, and you naturally became the landlady of the Fox Hotel. You were very happy, secretly planning that in a few more years, you might be able to return home. You remembered when you first arrived, you made a wish in front of the shrine: hoping to become the landlady quickly and be chosen by the Inari God to become a messenger, so that you could reunite with your daughter sooner. After making the wish, the shrine suddenly glowed, and a talisman appeared before you. You picked it up and tried to open it, but found it impossible to do so. You didn’t know if your wish would come true, but you kept the talisman with you.\nIndeed, not long after, you became the landlady. You thought your wish was quite effective. After you became the landlady, Nopperabo Lord began visiting the hotel even more frequently, sitting with you for an afternoon, celebrating with drinks, and happily saying, 'Amazing, you did great! Little A Yu, I knew you had the ability to become the landlady!' However, not long after you became the landlady, the hotel chef resigned and went home. You had no choice but to take over cooking for a while, hoping to find a new chef, but your cooking wasn’t very good; only your takoyaki was decent.\nOne day, a strange guest arrived at the hotel. It was a Kama-itachi. Upon seeing him, you couldn’t help but feel angry; you were trapped here because of these Kama-itachi! Otherwise, you, A Hu, and Xiao Bai would definitely be living happily together as a family of three. The Kama-itachi said to you, 'Landlady, I’m hungry. Is there food?' You replied curtly, 'Order!' and threw the menu in front of him. He ordered several dishes and asked if you could make them; you disdainfully said, 'No!' Until he carefully asked, 'Then... can you make takoyaki?' You were about to refuse again, but thought you needed to do business, so you begrudgingly went to the kitchen to make takoyaki.\nThe more you thought about it in the kitchen, the angrier you got. You deliberately added various seasonings to make it particularly inedible. After preparing it, you served it to him, and the Kama-itachi took a bite, silently looked at you, and then finished it all. You wondered if he was crazy to finish something so disgusting. But he looked at you with a wronged expression and said, 'Landlady, with this skill, you still run a restaurant?' He actually mocked you! Infuriated, you slammed the table and shouted, 'If you don’t want it, get lost!' He was startled, staring at you blankly. You thought for a moment; even though you hated Kama-itachi, this one in front of you was innocent—A Hu didn’t kill him after all. It seemed a bit excessive to treat him this way. So you took a deep breath and said, 'Our chef resigned. If you want to eat, you can. If you think it’s bad, you don’t have to pay.' The Kama-itachi blinked and said, 'Actually... it’s pretty good. By the way, can you make wishes?'\nYou took him to the shrine to make a wish, and you heard him tell the Inari God that he hoped to become the number one killer in Kyoto. You felt silently angry; indeed, there wasn’t a good one among the Kama-itachi! After he made his wish, he asked you, 'Landlady, do you know where I can become a killer in Kyoto?' You originally didn’t want to respond to him, but looking at his somewhat silly, innocent eyes, you thought of Nopperabo Lord. Nopperabo Lord was the leader of all the monsters in Kyoto; he had a 'Shin’en Group.' There should be some opportunities there, so you softened your heart and wrote him the address, introducing him to go there.\nBut to your surprise, two days later, the Kama-itachi returned and found you, saying. “Landlady, are you still in need of a chef? Do you think I can do it?” You looked at him in confusion, unsure of what he was trying to pull. He saw that you didn’t respond and hurriedly asked, “Do you look down on me? My knife skills are excellent!” Then he grabbed a potato and demonstrated a set of whirlwind cutting techniques, peeling the potato cleanly. You noticed that his knife skills were indeed impressive, and since you were tired of cooking, you agreed to let him stay and give it a try. You learned that this little Kama-itachi was named “Kazuki Ichiro.”\n\nHowever, it didn’t take long for you to realize that his cooking skills were only slightly better than yours; he was just good with a knife. But he worked hard, practicing cooking every day. He often came to ask you, “Landlady, what do you want to eat tonight? I made red bean soup. Would you like some?” You knew that your prejudice against the Kama-itachi was due to past events. As you got to know him better, you found that Kazuki Ichiro was actually a hardworking, optimistic young man. You became much gentler with him, occasionally helping him make new clothes, buy new shoes, and tidy up the rooms. After all, living together in the hotel, you had become like a family.\n\nIn the hotel, a group of Tengu often gathered for feasting and drinking. The Tengu belonged to the “Tianyu Institute.” They were the righteous messengers appointed by the deities of the divine realm, tasked with protecting Kyoto’s peace. However, these guys ate and drank here every day without paying, keeping tabs instead. Since they were public officials, you couldn’t refuse their business. You once took the ledger to the Tianyu Institute to settle accounts, but they made excuses, and there was nothing you could do about it.\n\nBut one Tengu was different; this Tengu was named “Mitsuharu.” He had visited the hotel even when he was just a regular Tengu. As a teenager, he was particularly polite. When he first saw you, he asked, “Excuse me, can I make a wish here?” You learned that Tengu had different ranks: there were regular Tengu, black Tengu, great Tengu, and daimyō. The daimyō were the highest-ranking beings in the Tianyu Institute, while black Tengu had no formal authority. You found this little Tengu cute as he made his wish: “I hope you can bless me, so that one day I can become a black Tengu and then a great Tengu!” Most people who made wishes to the gods were hoping for shortcuts, so this little Tengu was quite refreshing.\n\nLater, he often came to the hotel for meals, but he never drank with the other great Tengu. He always sat at a small table by himself, slowly eating and drinking. After finishing his meal, he would always pay. One day, he excitedly came to find you and said that he had become a black Tengu! He could now help the great Tengu with their cases and protect Kyoto! You were genuinely happy for him and prepared a sumptuous meal to celebrate together.\n\nA few years later, he had grown quite tall and now had a pair of large black wings. He entered the hotel and told you that he had been promoted to a great Tengu, having solved several major cases. Hearing this, you were thrilled, watching him rise step by step through his own efforts. You took out a bottle of fine wine you had treasured for years and said, “Come, let’s celebrate!” Everyone was happy as they ate and drank. You seriously said to him, “Now that you’re a great Tengu, I have a case for you!” You told him about A Hu’s incident in detail, hoping he could help you investigate A Hu’s death. The great Tengu replied, “Sure. Don’t worry, Sister A Yu, you’ve treated me so well; I’ll do my utmost to help you find the culprit.”\n\nAs the days passed, you missed Xiao Bai more and more. In a Kyoto alley, there was a shop called the Eight-Treasure Glass Shop, run by an old spider. He was a craftsman who made various magical tools for youkai. He had made combs and mirrors for you. The Eight-Treasure Glass Shop also served as a mail transfer station. You used him to send letters to your parents and learned from those letters about when Xiao Bai would start crawling and calling for her mother, asking when she would come back. Every time you read a letter, you would tear up. You had been gone for four years, and you didn’t know how much Xiao Bai had grown.\n\nOne day, when you were delivering a letter, you passed by a trash bin. You noticed a lot of resentment accumulating in it, so you opened it up and found a damaged doll about 20 centimeters tall, its face painted in a floral pattern, its clothes tattered, and its body filled with resentment. You realized that if you left this doll here, it would soon turn into a cursed doll. So you took it to the old spider and asked if he could repair it. The old spider was indeed Kyoto's best craftsman; with a flick of his wrist, he made it look brand new. You looked at the doll, now exquisite and cute, and prepared to give it to your daughter. When you picked it up, you found that it contained some youkai power, suggesting it was not an ordinary doll. You decided to bring it back to the hotel first.\n\nAfter returning to the hotel, the little doll miraculously came to life; not only could it move, but it could also talk. It sweetly said, “Thank you, kind big sister. My name is ‘Yuko,’ and I’m a discarded doll. But I never expected I could move here in this hotel.” You thought that perhaps because her spirit power was too weak, and since the hotel was closest to the divine realm, the spiritual energy here was abundant, allowing her to move freely. You took her in and let her call you “Sister A Yu. You arranged a room for her to stay. Since she was very small, normal furniture wouldn’t work, so you had Fēng Yīláng specially make miniature furniture for her. After that, she settled in and became a new family member.\n【Promise Under the Fireworks】\nAfter moving in, Yōu Zi became busy, perhaps wanting to express her gratitude for your hospitality. You could only have her learn to serve dishes and pour drinks for guests. But she was so small, nearly the size of a wine bottle, that serving and pouring was quite difficult for her. Sometimes she would bump into things and scrape her arms and legs, which made you feel heartbroken. You urged her to stop helping, but she stubbornly insisted on assisting you. Although you called her Yōu Zi sister, you felt as if she were your own daughter. You often made her little kimonos and styled her hair, growing closer and closer. Fēng Yīláng was also very kind to Yōu Zi, often making her sweet soup and tiny omelet rice. You all resembled a true family of three. Over time, you noticed that Fēng Yīláng was very attentive and gentle towards both you and Yōu Zi, and gradually you developed a vague feeling for him, but you chose to ignore this little flutter in your heart.\nOne day, Fēng Yīláng suddenly told you that there was going to be a fireworks festival near Kyoto. He asked if you wanted to go see it, handing you two tickets. Seeing the sincerity in his eyes, you nodded in agreement. On the day of the fireworks festival, you took out your most beautiful kimono, got ready, and met Fēng Yīláng at the entrance of the inn. When he saw you looking so lovely, he was momentarily stunned, staring blankly before lowering his head, timidly saying, 'A Yu... you look so beautiful today.' You smiled gently and patted his shoulder, saying, 'Stop dawdling. The fireworks are about to start; let’s go!'\nYou followed him to the festival at the foot of the mountain, where people were bustling about. Vendors were shouting to attract customers. Having never attended such a lively festival, you felt a bit overwhelmed. Fēng Yīláng seemed to sense your awkwardness and guided you around, buying candied apples, playing goldfish scooping games, and purchasing monster masks. After playing for a while, you followed the crowd up the hillside to prepare for the fireworks. When the brilliant fireworks shot into the sky and exploded, Fēng Yīláng suddenly turned to you and asked, 'A Yu, do you want me to cook for you forever?' You joked, 'What? Are you quitting your job?'\nHe blushed and looked at you, taking a deep breath before shouting, 'A Yu! I like you! Will you be with me?' Looking at his face, which was as red as a tomato and glimmering under the fireworks, you suddenly realized that you had long planted a seed of affection for Fēng Yīláng in your heart. However, he was a Kama-itachi, and A Hu had died at the hands of one. Plus, you still had Xiao Bai, so you had never let this small seed sprout. But somehow, this seed had taken root and bloomed in your heart. At this moment, you found it hard to straightforwardly admit your feelings because there was still a hurdle in your heart. In this conflicted state, you told him, 'Let’s make a deal, Lang. If one day everyone praises your cooking, I will agree to be with you.' Hearing this, his eyes lit up as if he had found a direction to work towards. He nodded emphatically, saying, 'A Yu, just you wait; I will definitely fulfill our promise!'\nEver since returning from the fireworks festival, the kitchen of Fēng Yīláng has been lit up all night. He worked even harder to research cooking, bothering every guest who came in to ask, 'Did you think today’s dish was delicious?' Of course, cooking skills can’t improve overnight, but he wasn’t discouraged, believing that hard work would yield rewards. You also told yourself that if he truly worked hard for you, you could let go of your reservations and try to be with him. After all, he was also a hardworking person worth trusting for a lifetime. If he couldn’t achieve it, it would mean fate wasn’t right yet. You thought it would be fine to just go on like this.\nThe Great Tengu, Michibiki, seemed to notice Fēng Yīláng’s changes towards you and occasionally teased you. But you realized that his recent visits to the inn weren’t as simple as before. Somehow, he had become close to Yōu Zi, often taking her out to play. You started to worry a bit; after all, Yōu Zi couldn’t move or speak when she was out, but every time she came back, she seemed very happy. To you, Michibiki also seemed like a reliable young man, so you felt reassured.\n【Strong Longing】\nRecently, a little red fox suddenly appeared at your door. Upon seeing you, she knelt down and said, 'Boss, can you take me in as your maid? I want to train here; my dream is to become a messenger of the Inari God! I will work very hard! Let me do anything!' Looking at her, you thought of Xiao Bai, who should be about this age now. However, when you recalled what your child looked like, you found her appearance had become vague in your memory, after all, it had been seven or eight years since you last saw her. 'Alright. I’ll give you a chance to stay here; let’s see your determination,' you said. Looking at the little fox always reminded you of your daughter, so you decided to keep her.\nYou had the little red fox named Xiao Nuan live with Yōu Zi since she was also small, about eighty centimeters tall. The two of them living together was quite convenient. However, at first, Yōu Zi didn’t seem to like her very much. But later, the two became incredibly close. Xiao Nuan worked especially hard; when you assigned her to clean, she would do it ten times and even wax the floor, resembling how you used to be. You sometimes tell her: 'Actually, you don't have to do so much. You're already doing great.' She would firmly respond, 'No, this is my training. Plus, this is a task given to me by Sister Ayu. Since you treat me so well, of course I want to repay you!' \nYou feel grateful to meet such a thoughtful little fox and care for her extra. She has a hobby of eating paw-print cookies, which are cookies made with her own little paw prints. She often asks you, 'Sister Ayu, do you want some paw-print cookies?' Every time you eat the cookies, you feel a warmth in your heart. Xiao Nuan is like a little sun, warming everyone around her. You treat her especially well; in your eyes, she is like your second daughter, and you give all the kindness you owe to Little Bai to Xiao Nuan.\nXiao Nuan has a great relationship with Kazui Ichiro, Lord Nopperabo, Daideng Hong, and Yuko. She makes little cookies and shares them with everyone. Sometimes you think, the Fox Hotel is your second home. Here, everyone is like family, even without blood relations. If you return home in the future, you will surely miss them. It would be great to bring Kazui Ichiro, Yuko, and Xiao Nuan back home together. A family should be together. However, Yuko turns into a little doll when she leaves the Fox Hotel, which troubles you.\nSince Kazui Ichiro became the chef, Lord Nopperabo has been coming over more often, going from every few days to daily. Ten days ago, he brought a guest to stay, a snow woman. She carries a cloud above her head that floats wherever she goes, and she looks very unhappy, gloomy. After moving in, she sealed the door with ice, so no one could enter or leave, even for meals. Yuko had to deliver food to the door. You have invited her several times for drinks and flower viewing, but each time you were coldly rejected. You understand if she wants to be alone, so you don't disturb her.\nLord Nopperabo often takes Xiao Nuan out to play, and she is very happy. Later, for some reason, Xiao Nuan starts knocking on the snow woman's door every day. But the snow woman never opens it. You notice Xiao Nuan's little paws are covered in wounds and frostbite, likely from knocking on that icy door. You feel heartbroken and advise her not to knock anymore. Xiao Nuan looks at you with watery eyes and says, 'The snow woman is already so sad alone. If I don't knock, who will go find her?' You gently pat Xiao Nuan's head and carefully tend to her wounds.\n【Little Bai, wait for Mommy】\nRecently, a divine messenger came down from the divine realm. He stopped at the hotel and chatted with you at night. He said he was finally going to retire after fanning the Inari God for 500 years in the heavens, and he could finally go home! Upon hearing this, you immediately became anxious: 'Didn’t they say once you become a divine messenger you can go home?' He took a sip of water and disdainfully said, 'That's a divine messenger, not a god! How can one just go home? You only serve as a divine official, fanning the Inari God. You must serve for 500 years to retire.' You were taken aback. Five hundred years? Would you still be able to see your daughter? This completely contradicted your plans. No, you cannot let this happen.\nAfter thinking for a long time, you came up with one solution! That divine messenger said that the Inari God would come down soon to select a new messenger. At that time, if you... if you killed him, you could go home. The Fox Hotel has a restriction: every candidate for training cannot leave too far and must return at set times. If you could kill the Inari God, the restriction would be lifted, and everything would end. You were startled by this thought! Killing a god is a grave sin. But you miss your daughter too much, especially since Xiao Nuan came; you miss Little Bai even more. You want to go home! To make up for the motherly love you have missed all these years. To accompany her as she grows up. You secretly ask the divine messenger, 'What does the Inari God like?' You want to take the opportunity to please him. The divine messenger says: 'Don't mention it. That fat guy has recently taken a liking to the monster cards you’ve been playing, dragging us to play every day, and he can't stand losing. He gets angry when he loses. We have to let him win.' \nMonster cards? Isn’t that the game everyone loves to play at the hotel? Every week on your day off, you all gather to play monster cards. This is the most popular card game in the demon realm. You enjoy playing monster cards because every time you do, your family gathers together around the warm table, sharing laughter and arguments, which feels particularly warm. The cards in 'Monster Cards' feature cute little demon avatars. Each card has different attributes. If the card matches your own attributes, you can even establish a connection with it, drive cards of the same attribute, and even release a little spell to play pranks on everyone. Foxes are fire attribute demons, so you can drive the fire attribute Zashiki-warashi card. You have trained for many years, so your demon power is strong, but you rarely use spells to prank others, especially since they are all your family. Recently, Lord Nopperabo has also been playing cards with you, but he wins every time, only playing two rounds and then saying you are all too inexperienced and should practice more.\nAfter thinking it over, it might be better to organize a card game when the Inari God comes down. If you take the chance to play tricks during the monster card game, the success rate will definitely be high! But you don't know any spells for killing gods, and using the old cards from the hotel would certainly raise suspicion. After a long time, you finally come up with a plan: seek out the spider elder. If it’s him, he must have a way. After all, you have been friends for many years; he should help you.\nKazui Ichiro notices you seem troubled. He grabs your hand and asks, 'Ayu, what’s wrong these days? Is there something on your mind?''You don't know how to start, so you just dodge the question. But he insists on getting a clear answer. After thinking for a moment, you invite him to your room at night. That evening, you prepare two bottles of liquor and, when he comes in, you place them in front of him and say, 'Let's drink first.' Without hesitation, Wind Ichiro finishes it. With the alcohol giving you courage, you say, 'Ichiro, to be honest, I don't dislike you, nor do I not want to accept you. It's just... I have a daughter back in my hometown. My childhood friend died, and only my parents are taking care of her. I understand your feelings, but I’m trapped in this hotel. I can't go home or see my daughter. Soon, I need to go to the Divine Realm to fan Inari for five hundred years! I'm sorry, I want to go home, so I might have to do something very dangerous. In a few days, Lord Inari will come, and I will execute my plan! I don't want to drag you into this. You should leave far away, and it’s best if you take Yuko and Xiao Nuan with you!' He immediately interrupts you, walks over, and hugs you tightly, saying, 'If you're doing something this dangerous, I won't let you go alone. Is that what a man does? Whatever happens, we’ll face it together. If you want to slay a god, I'll slay it with you! Don't worry, I’ll make sure you get home, you have to believe me.' These words deeply touch you, and you realize this young man is truly someone reliable. But now isn’t the time for sweet nothings. You gently lean your head on his shoulder and say, 'But a promise is a promise; you still need to let everyone say you cook well before I agree to anything.' He firmly replies, 'Okay. You believe me. I will do what I promised you!'Though Wind Ichiro has made a promise and is dependable, you really don't want to involve him. What if something happens to you? He still needs to take care of the hotel and the two kids. So, you don't tell him your plan. You are preparing to find the Spider Elder when you notice Yuko's left arm has lost some paint again, so you decide to touch it up. You take Yuko to the mundane world and set her down at the entrance. You go inside to find the Spider Elder and explain your purpose. He looks at you and says, 'Ayu, why do you want to do something so dangerous?' Fearing he won't agree, you kneel down with a thud, crying as you express your longing for your daughter. The Spider Elder sighs and says, 'Alright, Ayu, I agree. I can help you make a new set of cards, but we can't let others easily suspect you, right? How about I place a dormant slaying spell on each card? Before it’s your turn to play, you activate any card in your hand containing the slaying spell. Once you awaken the spell in that card, it will act like a virus. When it touches the next player's hand, all the cards it has touched will awaken their slaying spells. Then, no matter what card you give to the next player, the already activated slaying spell will continue to awaken all dormant spells in the touched cards. It will pass down like this, awakening all the slaying spells in the hand cards. However, your demonic power isn’t enough to activate the slaying spell. You need to find a demon pearl containing strong demonic power to temporarily enhance your power by crushing it before playing the cards, allowing you to activate the slaying spell.'Following the Spider Elder's instructions, you search for a day and night, sneaking into the wolf demon clan, where you find a seemingly dirty pearl. Although this gray pearl looks unimpressive, you can distinctly feel the powerful earth attribute demonic power within it. You take this pearl back to the Eight Treasure Glaze Workshop, where the Spider Elder hands you Yuko, now with her paint touched up, and a new set of cards with spells placed on them, along with a box to store the precious demon pearl. He warns you to be cautious. After sincerely thanking him, you return to the hotel. These days, your heart is filled with conflict; clearly, you're about to go home, yet you suddenly find yourself reluctant to leave the hotel. After all, this has been your home for so long. You wander around the hotel, wanting to remember every brick and tile. As you do, you accidentally catch a glimpse of a figure darting past, but you can't catch up. From the back, it looks like a stranger wolf demon. However, there is no such guest at the hotel. Why is a wolf demon in the hotel? You're worried that something unexpected might happen in a couple of days, but with the arrow already on the string, you have to shoot.'",
            "Script": "【Morning Sunlight】\nYou woke up early today. Today is a very special day for you. Whether your plan will succeed depends entirely on today. You chose to wear a black kimono and styled your long hair up. After tidying yourself up, you took out the prepared demon orb from the box in your wardrobe. Last night, you secretly put away the old set of cards that everyone usually uses into the drawer and placed the new set of cards you prepared on the usual card-playing table.\nYou finished getting ready and went out. Kazutora was already waiting for you at the door. He gently took your hand and led you to the hall. You didn't expect that the Sky Dog would arrive here even earlier than you. After you and Kazutora sat down, you noticed that the cards on the table had already been shuffled and divided into eight piles. You remembered that last night, you had stacked them all neatly. Worried about unexpected changes, you carefully observed; it was indeed the set of cards you prepared. You felt relieved. After a while, the rarely seen Snow Woman surprisingly came out of her room and sat quietly next to the Sky Dog without saying a word. Shortly after, the Nopperabo brother also arrived. He greeted everyone and sat on the other side of the Sky Dog.\nFinally, with the sound of running footsteps echoing down the corridor, Xiao Nuan came running in, pulling along a Yuko who looked half asleep. Xiao Nuan sat between the Nopperabo and you, while Yuko seemed to have something on her mind, sitting quietly between Kazutora and the Snow Woman, at a loss for words.",

The god-slaying curse does not harm demons. According to your plan, that Mountain Child will awaken all the god-slaying curses in the cards held by Ichiro. No matter what card he plays, it will awaken the cards in Yuko's hand, and so the game continues until it reaches the Inari God.

        "Кama-itachi": {
            "Story": "You are Feng Yilang, the chef of the Fox Hotel.\n—What do you truly want?\n【Father's Will】\nYou are a Kama-itachi named Feng Yilang. You were born in a remote Kama-itachi village, which is more like an assassination organization than a village. All the adult Kama-itachi in the village are professional assassins, while the little Kama-itachi wait at home for their parents to return. When their parents come back, they teach the little Kama-itachi how to be assassins. Every day is filled with fighting and killing. Only your father is a special existence in this village. He is an unusual Kama-itachi. While other fathers go out to fight and kill every day, your father spends his days peeling potatoes in the kitchen. Other children eagerly wait for their fathers to return and excitedly ask, 'Dad! What amazing mission did you complete today?' But your father only asks you, 'Have you peeled today's potatoes? There are still 20 more to go!'\nYou can't understand your father. Actually, when your father first taught you how to peel potatoes, you were quite happy. You thought this job was fun. But later, you realized you didn't fit in with your friends, who talked about the martial arts moves they learned or the killing techniques they mastered. Gradually, you stopped daring to talk to them. Eventually, when your friends found out your true situation, they started to exclude you, mocking you: 'Hmph! You? How many potatoes did you peel today? Did you peel any carrots?' Slowly, you didn’t want to go out and play with them anymore. You had no friends left. You also didn’t want to sit in the kitchen with your father peeling potatoes every day… You were sad and said to your mom, 'Mom! Why can't Dad be like other dads and go out to fight? Isn’t Dad weak? He must be timid, hiding in our little kitchen instead of going out to kill!' Mom just smiled at this and patted your head, telling you, 'Yilang, you need to understand your dad. He does this because he loves you and loves this family. He is not what you think. He is great.' You thought to yourself, 'No way! My dad is just a useless Kama-itachi! I don't want a dad like that!' Other fathers in your eyes are tall and mighty, especially since other kids say that there is a top assassin in Kyoto, who is also a Kama-itachi. He is the pride of the entire Kama-itachi clan.\nThis mysterious top assassin became your idol. You wished that such a person was your father. Finally, after being mocked by your friends again, you couldn't help but go to your father and say, 'Can you teach me how to kill? Teach me some killing techniques or something? Are you just a coward, or do you really not know any powerful techniques?' Your father became angry and sternly told you, 'You focus on practicing peeling potatoes! Do you know what killing means?' This argument with your father completely escalated the conflict between you. In a fit of anger, you ran away from home, thinking that at worst you could go to Kyoto and find that top assassin. I can be his son! If that doesn’t work, I can at least be his apprentice! Anyway, I don’t want to stay in this broken kitchen peeling potatoes all day!\nBefore leaving, you remembered your father's precious box. He has always cherished it, maybe it contains some martial arts secrets. But Dad is too timid to practice? You secretly took the box with you and headed straight for Kyoto without looking back. On the way, you tried to open the box, but it had a password lock. You attempted to enter your parents' wedding anniversary, birthdays, and other significant dates, but couldn’t unlock it. When you arrived in Kyoto, you discovered that it was much larger than your hometown! It was a bustling city you had never seen before. At this moment, you realized you were completely unprepared. You had no solid plan to find a master. You could only look for a temporary place to stay. After asking around, you ended up at a famous monster inn located in Inari Mountain, the Fox Hotel. You were greeted by a particularly beautiful white nine-tailed fox proprietress. You had never seen such a stunning person. Although you had only seen Kama-itachi since childhood, the most beautiful Kama-itachi was nothing compared to even a single strand of the proprietress's fox tail. You were momentarily captivated and stammered, 'Madam, I’m hungry. Is there any food?' The proprietress seemed to be in a bad mood. She threw the menu in front of you and coldly said, 'Order!' You nervously sat down and began to order. 'One… not available!' 'One… no!' You wondered why the proprietress was so unfriendly. Was she always like this? But you didn’t dare to speak up, because she was so beautiful. In the end, you helplessly looked at the last item on the menu and asked, 'Can you make takoyaki?'\nThe proprietress hesitated for a moment and said, 'Fine, wait!' After speaking, she turned and entered the kitchen. After a while, she brought out a plate of takoyaki. There were three pieces in total, and as you ate one, you thought, this flavor… Not to mention your dad's cooking, even your own skills don’t compare! Just as you were about to complain, you noticed she was watching you. You think to yourself: forget it. You're hungry, so you decide to eat the last two takoyaki. After finishing, you look at the boss lady and ask, 'How did you open this place with your skills?' You actually just want to ask her, but she seems to think you're mocking her. She slams the table and says, 'If you want to eat, eat! If not, get lost!' You feel wronged. Seeing your expression, the boss lady softens a bit and says, 'Our chef quit a few days ago, and I'm not good at cooking. If you think it tastes bad, you don't have to pay.' Hearing this, you realize you can't blame her; such a beautiful person shouldn't be in the kitchen anyway!\nYou quickly respond, 'Oh, it’s fine! I'm full. Let's settle the bill!' Then you ask the boss lady, 'Can you make wishes here?' Besides dining and lodging, the Fox Hotel also has a function where you can make wishes to Inari, the main deity of the Kyoto area. The boss lady says, 'Sure, my wishes are quite effective. Give it a try!' She leads you to a shrine with a box for the deity, where a statue of Inari—a chubby figure with a round belly and a high hat—sits. You clasp your hands and wish, 'Please bless me to become the number one killer in Kyoto!' After making the wish, the shrine suddenly glows, and a charm appears before you. You pick it up and try to open it but find it won't budge. You don’t know if your wish will come true, but you still carry the charm with you. 'Pfft! Hahaha!' The boss lady laughs behind you. You turn to her and ask, 'Do you know where I can find someone hiring killers in Kyoto?' She thinks for a moment and replies, 'I actually do! There’s a monster with a really long head called Nopperabo. Go seek him out.\n[Inner Hopes]\nYou happily thank her and leave the Fox Hotel, heading to the address the boss lady gave you. It’s a large courtyard with a sign reading 'Shin'en Group.' Inside, there are many monsters, but after searching for a while, you can’t find the one with the long head and only manage to find one with a slightly shorter head. You ask him, 'Are you Lord Nopperabo?' He looks you over and says, 'I’m not! I’m the second-in-command here. Why are you looking for the boss?' You reply, 'I was sent by the boss lady of the Fox Hotel. I’m here to apply for the killer position!' The second-in-command sizes you up and asks, 'What skills do you have? What makes you think you can be a killer?' You think to yourself: I can only peel potatoes. If I say that, will they send me to the kitchen to cook?\nFortunately, your family's potato peeling isn't like regular households, because the Kama-itachi family belongs to the wind type, and wind-type monsters use wind blades. Although you only use your wind blades for peeling potatoes. Suddenly, you have a brilliant idea: why not imagine this monster in front of you as a potato and treat him like one to peel?! Just as you set your pose, someone calls from behind, 'Futaro~' Huh? Futaro is your dad's name! In such a big place as Kyoto, someone actually recognizes your dad? You turn around to see a monster with an incredibly long head—he must be Lord Nopperabo! You turn back to him and ask, 'What do you want with my dad? Do you know him?' Lord Nopperabo smiles and says, 'You’re Futaro’s son! Come on in and have a seat.' He leads you into the inner room and sets you down. After you sit, Lord Nopperabo asks, 'How has your dad been all these years? He left without saying a word, and I’ve always been concerned about him.' Oh? So your father used to be a chef in Kyoto? No wonder his skills are decent. You ask him, 'Lord, did my father work in your... your residence as a chef?'\nLord Nopperabo looks at you and laughs, 'Hahaha! A chef? Your dad was the number one killer in all of Kyoto, you know? He never missed a hit in all his years as a killer. He executed assassination tasks beautifully, taking down targets like peeling potatoes. Isn't it a bit unfair for him to be a chef?' You exclaim, 'Are you sure you’re talking about my dad? Futaro? The number one killer in Kyoto?' Lord Nopperabo confirms, 'Yes. You are cut from the same cloth as your father.' You can hardly believe it, murmuring, 'Impossible. My dad runs a small restaurant now. He spends all day in the kitchen peeling potatoes, hunched over; he doesn’t look like a killer at all. Plus, he’s really timid. He’s the only Kama-itachi in our village who became a chef.' Lord Nopperabo ponders for a moment and asks, 'How old are you?' You tell him, 'Sixteen or seventeen.'\nHe thinks for a moment and says, 'I see… Let me tell you something! Back then, I sent your dad on a mission to a remote fox demon village. At that time, I received intel saying that there was imminent conflict between two fox demon villages. It was reported that the neighboring Red Fox Village even hired a killer to assassinate the son of the White Fox Village's leader.'To prevent the outbreak of war, I quickly sent Wind Taro, your father, to protect the chieftain's son. However, after waiting many days, your father never returned. I had no choice but to send another subordinate to check. After gathering information, he came back and told me that the chieftain's son of the White Fox Village had died, but there were no large-scale conflicts between the two clans. The two tribes were living in peace. I always wondered if your father had accidentally failed and felt too embarrassed to return, worried about losing face as the top assassin. But when I calculated your age, I realized your parents had just gotten married around that time. Your mother must have been pregnant, and your father probably seized the opportunity to wash his hands of the assassin life. After all, being an assassin is a dangerous profession, and one could encounter unexpected events at any time. Your father gave up his fame and status to provide a stable life for you and your mother. He even secretly took your mother back to Kama-itachi Village to open a restaurant, abandoning the large mansion and farmland in Kyoto. Believe it or not, your dad loved cooking even when he was an assassin. He chose this peaceful life, this stable life for you, and you should understand him. Your father is truly great.After listening to the words of the Nopperabo, an image of your father suddenly appeared in your mind, and then—bang!—it merged with the image of the top assassin in Kyoto. Your father wasn’t a timid Kama-itachi, was he? You picked up the box and suddenly guessed a password. It was the day your father first taught you to pick up a kitchen knife! After entering the password, the box really opened. Inside the box was a 'Comprehensive Cookbook.' 'Page 1: Teriyaki Rice, Page 2: Mixed Fish Soup, Page 3: Thick Omelette. The further you flip, the more difficult it gets. The last few pages introduce the process and recipes for Kaiseki cuisine.'So this was the treasure your father had cherished for a long time, which he wanted to give you, hoping you'd learn cooking. He didn’t want your future to be too dangerous. You began to think: Did you really hate cooking? Not really. You were happy when you first learned to handle a knife. It was only later, because the other kids ostracized you, that you wanted to become an assassin, but did you really like being an assassin? You didn’t know. You didn’t even know how to be an assassin. Suddenly, you were unsure of what you truly wanted. At that moment, the Nopperabo asked you, 'What did you come to Kyoto for?' As you pondered, you casually replied, 'I wanted to come to you to be an assassin...' The Nopperabo said, 'Then stay here with me, and I’ll have someone teach you how to be an assassin, okay?' You felt even more confused. You realized you had misunderstood your father for so long, even if only in your heart. But why not give it a try, reconcile with your father, and see if the path he wanted you to choose was what you wanted? Why not... start learning from the first page of this book until the last? If you found you really didn’t like cooking, you could still pursue your own path later. After all, you were only a teenager, still very young. If you discovered later that you agreed with your father’s ideas, you could go back and sincerely apologize to him, right? Finally, it seemed like you understood. You slammed the table and stood up, saying, 'Sir, I think being a chef might be quite good. I want to give it a try. Farewell, sir!' After thanking him, you turned and left the [New Garden Group].Once you stepped outside, you realized: 'Where can I go to be a chef? After thinking for a long time—ah! The Fox Hotel! They’re short of a chef, aren’t they?' You hurried to the hotel and found the landlady, asking, 'Landlady! Are you in need of a chef? Do you think I’m up for it?' The landlady laughed and said, 'Weren’t you going to be an assassin? Why do you want to come back to be a chef? It’s only been a day; how did you change so fast?' Worried she wouldn’t hire you, you hurriedly said, 'Do you look down on me? Just wait!' With that, you went to the kitchen, took a potato, and with the knife in your hand moving back and forth, you performed a whirlwind potato peeling technique, creating a perfectly peeled potato. The landlady watched in awe: 'What excellent knife skills! You can stay here and be a chef!'【Everyone at the Hotel】And so, you settled in at the hotel. You thought you would have to live under the same roof as the landlady and maintain a good relationship with her, so you often asked her, 'What would you like to eat today?' 'Would you like some red bean soup?' Back and forth, you learned the landlady’s name: A Yu. After a while, you discovered that A Yu’s temper wasn’t that bad; she might have just been in a bad mood recently. Gradually, she became much gentler with you, occasionally helping you make new clothes, buy new shoes, and tidy your room. After all, living together in this hotel, you were like a family. A Yu was really nice, beautiful, and kind. At that time, you didn’t think much; A Yu reminded you of your gentle mother. Since you became the head chef at the Fox Hotel, you discovered that the Nopperabo often came to the hotel to eat for free! The grand leader of the monsters didn’t pay for meals! Moreover, when he found out you worked there, his visits went from two or three times a week to every day!One time, you heard him say to A Yu, 'A Yu, you know I’m the boss of Kyoto, right? I’ve got you covered. Don’t worry about anything happening at your hotel in the future; I’ll just eat for free. Isn’t that right?' But A Yu would always smile and set out an extra pair of chopsticks for him.After all, Ayu is the boss, so you can't really say much. You can only deliberately make him some not-so-delicious dishes each time, hoping to force him not to come. But the Sky Dog has a thick skin; no matter how bad your cooking is, he always says, “Not bad! Keep it up, kid!”\nHowever, you and Ayu share a common dislike: the Sky Dogs who often come to the inn in groups to eat and drink. The Sky Dogs belong to the Heavenly Guardian Institute, an organization that protects all of Kyoto. But they never pay for their meals, only keeping tabs. Ayu has tried to collect money a few times but hit a wall. Yet, public servants cannot refuse service, which troubles Ayu greatly.\nOne day, Ayu went to the city and came back with a doll about 30 centimeters tall, just high enough to reach your knees when it jumps. Surprisingly, this little doll could move and talk! It turned out she was a little monster named Yuko. With nowhere to go, she stayed at the inn. You found her tiny and adorable, calling you “Brother Kazuo~ Brother Kazuo~” every day. Being an only child, you came to treat little Yuko as your sister. Knowing children like sweet soups, you often made her red bean desserts, which she loved. Not long ago, Ayu asked you to make a set of special furniture for Yuko, as a normal bed was too high for her to climb. Your knife skills are impressive, and you also have some carpentry skills. You made Yuko a set of mini furniture suitable for her height. The three of you lived happily in the inn. Although Yuko is small, because you and Ayu treat her well, she naturally wants to help out. So, Yuko often assists in serving dishes and pouring drinks for guests, but due to her height, she has to balance plates on her head and hold bottles to pour. The bottles are as tall as she is. Although she often chips paint in the process, she works hard.\nThe Promise Under the Fireworks\nLife at the inn is peaceful and happy. Through this time together, your feelings for Ayu deepened; her every smile moved your heart. One day, you saw a notice about an upcoming fireworks festival down the mountain. You secretly bought two tickets, deciding to use this opportunity to express your feelings to Ayu. Nervously, you invited her, saying, “Ayu, do you want to go see the fireworks festival with me?” To your surprise, Ayu agreed happily! On the day of the festival, you waited at the inn's entrance. When Ayu appeared, you were stunned. She wore a beautiful kimono you had never seen before, elegantly adorned before you. For a moment, you were speechless, gently saying, “Ayu... you look so beautiful today.” She smiled lightly, patted your shoulder, and said, “Don’t dawdle; the fireworks are about to start. Let’s go.”\nYou took her to the festival at the foot of the mountain, where people crowded around. Vendors shouted enthusiastically. You noticed Ayu looked a bit lost. You gently pulled her from stall to stall. You bought candied apples, played goldfish scooping, and even got monster masks. After a long time of fun, you followed the crowd up the hill to prepare for the fireworks. As the brilliant fireworks soared and exploded in the sky, you mustered your courage and suddenly turned to Ayu, asking, “Ayu, do you want me to keep cooking for you?” Ayu smiled and asked, “Why? Are you going to quit?” You blushed, looking at her, took a deep breath, and shouted, “Ayu! I like you! Would you be with me?” Ayu looked into your eyes, thought for a long time, and said, “Ichiro, let’s make a promise: if one day everyone praises your cooking as delicious, I’ll agree to be with you.” Upon hearing this, your eyes sparkled. You weren’t really good at cooking; you just had good knife skills. You started learning to cook from the first page of a cookbook after coming to the inn. But cooking isn't something that can be mastered overnight, so your skills were only average. Suddenly, it felt like you found a goal and direction in life. You nodded vigorously, saying, “Ayu, just watch; I will fulfill our promise!”\nAfter returning, you spent all night in the kitchen practicing, leaving the lights on. Every day, you practiced the recipes from your father’s book like a madman. Now, whenever a guest finished your dish, you would eagerly ask, “Guest, do you think my cooking is good now?” However, your skills were still not high; any goal takes time to achieve. Guests would often suggest, “Not salty enough; too bland; the cooking isn’t quite right.” Even though every time you asked, guests would point out various issues, you didn’t get discouraged. You encouraged yourself, saying, “It’s okay, take it slow. I’ll get better and better; as long as I work hard, I can become the best cook!” One day, Ayu will be with me!\nRecently, a Tengu has been getting particularly close to Yuko. You notice Yuko seems to like this Tengu, but every time you think of those troublesome Tengu, you just can't let go of your prejudice. Whenever you see the Tengu taking Yuko out to play, you want to tell her, 'Don't get too close to the Tengu; they are all a bunch of freeloading bastards!' But Yuko always comes back from her outings so happy. So, you end up swallowing your words. Your sister enjoys playing with him; can you really stop that? So, you can only keep a close eye on him, urging him to bring Yuko back soon, but he always brings her back safely as promised. Even if you're not happy about it, there's nothing you can do.\nOne day, a small red fox appears at the entrance of your inn, short and small. She kneels at the door, asking Ayu to take her in, saying she wants to stay and cultivate. Ayu lets her stay. You notice Ayu is particularly kind to this red fox, even more so than to Yuko. Ayu arranges for Xiao Nuan and Yuko to share a room. After all, one is 30 cm and the other is 80 cm; they are about the same size, and using small furniture is convenient. When the little fox sees you, she sweetly says, 'Brother Windichiro, my name is Xiao Nuan. Please take care of me from now on~ By the way, do you want to try paw-shaped cookies? They are small cookies shaped like little paws, very cute. After eating them, a warmth rises in your heart.\nAlthough Yuko seemed to not like Xiao Nuan at first, she gradually accepted her. Ayu likes her and treats her well, so you also grow fond of her. You develop the habit of asking Ayu what meal she wants every day, then asking Yuko what snack she wants, and finally checking with Xiao Nuan about what sweet soup she would like. Whenever you prepare a meal for Yuko, you also make a portion for Xiao Nuan because you know she loves cookies. When you go shopping, you always buy her many flavors of cookies, but her favorite is still the paw-shaped ones. These cookies can't be bought outside; they are made with Xiao Nuan's own little paws. You help her make them since she is too small to do other work. You cut the dough into small pieces, and at the last step, you lift her onto a chair to press her tiny paw prints into the dough, and then bake it. After all, Yuko has one sister, so adding another Xiao Nuan is just another sister. A family of four sounds nice, doesn't it?\nYour family of four lives happily and peacefully in the Fox Inn. One day, Nopperabo brought a new guest, a strange snow woman. She walks under a cloud that follows her everywhere, looking very unhappy. Once she moves in, she freezes her room door, preventing anyone from entering. Ayu has invited the snow woman several times, but she always declines, only allowing meals to be delivered to the door. Still, you follow your usual routine, knocking on her door after delivering meals to ask, 'How was today's meal?' But the snow woman only coldly replies, 'Disgusting. Get lost!'\nYou continue to ask her about the meal daily, but she still only says, 'Disgusting, get lost!' One day, you finally lose your patience and ask her why it's bad, hoping she'll explain what's wrong with it. She ignores you. You grow more anxious, even grabbing a kitchen knife, wanting to break down her ice door to argue with her. Unfortunately, the ice door is too thick, and you only leave two shallow marks on it. The snow woman mocks you from inside, saying, 'It's just bad. Why do you ask so much? It's disgusting!' You can't stand this snow woman; she's the biggest obstacle in your pursuit of Ayu!\n【The Most Important Person】\nIn recent days, you notice Ayu is particularly unhappy. She used to be cheerful and caring towards guests, but now she often seems distracted or locks herself in her room like the snow woman. You keep wondering why Ayu is unhappy... Maybe it's because a divine envoy from Inari showed up at the Fox Inn a couple of days ago. After the envoy left, Ayu started feeling down. You ask Ayu, but she gives you a frowning evasive response. You persistently ask her many times, and finally, one day, Ayu says, 'Windichiro, come to my room tonight.' You feel a bit excited! Tonight! Ayu's room! When evening comes, you arrive at Ayu's room. Ayu says nothing but takes out two bottles of sake and places them in front of you, saying, 'Drink up.' \nAfter drinking, Ayu looks at you with flushed cheeks and says, 'Ichiro, it's not that I don't like you. It's not that I don't accept you. It's just that I had a childhood sweetheart I really liked. My family arranged a marriage, but it never happened because he was killed. I got pregnant and had a child, but I was forced to leave her. I haven't seen my daughter or parents in over ten years. I'm trapped in the Fox Inn. I yearn every day to go home, but I can't. I'm controlled by the restrictions here. So I can only take a risk; I've made up my mind that in a few days, when Inari comes to select the next envoy, I will take the opportunity to keep him here.' \nYou think: Inari? That's the main deity of the entire Kyoto region. Who could live after killing him? But you don't tell Ayu your thoughts. Ayu said: 'Feng Yilang, you are a good person. We've been together for so long and lived so many years; I don't want to involve you. Just leave! Get as far away from here as you can, and it would be best if you could take Xiao Nuan and Yuko with you. Just leave me here, and don’t worry about me anymore.' After hearing this, you excitedly rushed over and hugged her tightly, saying: 'Is it appropriate for you to push me away when you want to do something so dangerous? When I told you those things, did you think I was joking? Am I still a man if I leave? Let me tell you, Ayu, whatever you do, I will be with you. If you want to slay a god, I'll slay a god with you! I will definitely get you home; you have to believe me.' Ayu blushed and gently leaned on your shoulder, saying: 'But, a promise is a promise! You still have to make everyone think you cook well before I agree.' You looked at her firmly: 'You trust me! I will definitely do what I promised you! You know, at this moment, you are already connected in heart and mind, but now is not the time for sweet nothings.After leaving the room, you calmly thought: you absolutely cannot let Ayu slay a god. If she really kills a god, she will never be able to return home, and she will definitely be taken to the heavens for trial. There’s no other way: 'I'll help her take down this god so Ayu can go home. I always dreamed of being a great hero, right? This is my chance!' You told yourself that you must stop Ayu from taking action; this matter can only be handled by you. You don’t know what Ayu’s plan is, but you noticed that she seems to have secretly created a new monster card in the mundane world. Could it be related to the monster cards? Speaking of monster cards, you are very familiar with them; they are the most popular game everyone loves to play at the inn! Every weekly rest day, you all gather together to play monster cards. This is the most popular card game in the demon realm.You really enjoy playing monster cards because every time you play, the whole family gathers around the warm table, and the lively atmosphere feels particularly warm. Since Yuko can’t reach the warm table, you made a small stool for her to use while playing cards. The cards in 'Monster Cards' feature cute little demon avatars. Each card has different attributes. If a card matches your own attributes, you can connect with it, drive cards of the same attribute, and even release a small charm to play tricks on everyone. Kama-itachi is a wind attribute demon, and you can drive the wind attribute card 'Yatagarasu,' but you rarely use charms to prank others since they are your family. Recently, Lord Nopperabo has also been joining you for card games, but he wins every time while only playing two rounds, then says you all are too weak and should practice more. You privately think that when the time comes, you’ll sit at Ayu’s next turn. No matter what card Ayu plays, you will block her card so it won’t pass to the next player, preventing her from playing. Then, you can find an opportunity to play a Yatagarasu card and cast a spell that can slay gods.[In the Moment of Killing]A few days ago, in the early morning, you were practicing your knife skills when Yuko suddenly rushed over to find you, saying: 'Brother! I did something bad! I fell asleep in Sister Ayu's room, and when I woke up, I found a strange wolf demon rummaging through Sister Ayu's things. I killed him, but I couldn't move the body!' You thought to yourself that little Yuko is so small; she can only poke someone’s knee when she jumps. How could she possibly kill someone? You reassured Yuko: 'You probably had a nightmare. Are you feeling stressed lately? Do you want some red bean soup?' But Yuko anxiously replied: 'No! Brother! You have to come with me!' She tugged at your clothes, pulling you to a corner next to Ayu’s room, but there was nothing there. You prepared to pick her up and said: 'You must have had a nightmare. There’s nothing here! Come on! Let’s go out and eat something!'Yuko got anxious: 'No, Feng Yilang! Listen to me. Not long ago, my sister took me to see the Spider Elder at the Eight-Treasure Glass Workshop. He’s the craftsman who specializes in repairing lacquerware for me! That day, my sister brought me there and left me at the door while she went in to talk to the Spider Elder. I saw Sister Ayu kneeling and crying. Then she went out, and it took a long time. It seemed like she asked the Spider Elder to make something. While I was there, I heard the Spider Elder mumbling about something being a great sin for slaying gods! He also said that although he has known Ayu for many years, he still has to apologize to her... I felt really scared. After Sister Ayu came back, the Spider Elder handed her something, and we returned together. When I was sleeping today, I saw that wolf demon rummaging through Sister Ayu's room; he must have been looking for that thing, so I wanted to kill him...' You thought Yuko’s earlier words might be true. But the latter part was definitely due to stress. You originally wanted to let this matter pass, but the more you thought about it, the more something felt off.Ayu’s plan must be related to that Spider Elder. What if the Spider Elder really sells out Ayu? No way! You returned to the kitchen, randomly grabbed a narrow and thin kitchen knife from your cutting board, tucked it away, and set off to the mundane world. You arrived at the Eight-Treasure Glass Workshop and saw an old spider as soon as you entered. You asked: 'Tell me! Did you help Ayu make something not long ago? Did you tell anyone else?' The Spider Elder asked: 'Who are you?' 'It doesn't matter who I am! If you dare to tell anyone about this, I swear I will kill you!' You revealed the kitchen knife you brought. 'You stinky Kama-itachi want to kill me? Let me tell you, while you're here talking nonsense, you might as well hurry back home and stop Ayu from doing such things. Have you thought about the consequences? You should advise Ayu not to do this.' Upon hearing this, you realized that this damn Spider Elder would definitely spill the beans! Without thinking, you activated the Wind Blade and swung the knife towards him, fully aware that you might harm Ayu. You showed no mercy. Just as you looked down at the knife and the flowing purple blood, fear suddenly gripped you. Holding the knife, you hurriedly ran back to the inn. Once back in your room, you quickly cleaned the blood off the knife and casually tossed it onto the cutting board.You kept thinking: This is your first time killing someone... The feeling of killing is really bad... You used to want to be an assassin. What kind of assassin? You don’t even like the feeling of killing, but what can you do? For Ayu, you had no other choice. How nice it would be to go back to the peaceful and happy life you had before. Unfortunately... you can’t go back...",
            "Script": "【Morning Sunlight】\nToday, as soon as you got up, you went to Ayu's room. You knew today was the most important day. Today, Lord Inari would come down to select a new divine messenger, and it was also the day Ayu would carry out her plan. You waited early at Ayu's door for her. Once she was ready, you gently took her hand and led her to the hall. To your surprise, Sky Dog had arrived here even earlier than you.\nAfter you and Ayu sat down, you noticed that the set of cards on the table had already been shuffled into 8 parts. But neither of you had any plans to play. After a while, the rarely seen Yuki-onna unexpectedly came out of her room and into the hall. She didn’t speak, just quietly sat beside Sky Dog. Not long after, Nopperabo also arrived. He greeted everyone and sat down on the other side of Sky Dog.\nFinally, with the sound of running footsteps echoing in the corridor, Xiao Nuan came over, pulling along the still-sleepy Yuko. Xiao Nuan sat between you and Nopperabo. Yuko, however, seemed to have something on her mind. After a long time, she ended up sitting between Fuyi Lang and Yuki-onna. For a moment, no one spoke.",

After that, you cast a God-slaying Wind Blade curse with the next card, the Yatagarasu. The God-slaying curse won’t harm youkai, and you’re not sure if it was your Yatagarasu that ended up in his hands leading to his death. You don’t know what Ayu's plan is, or if she has made other preparations, and whether Inari's death is related to Ayu. But at least now, Ayu can go home, and you have succeeded.\nHowever, those two divine messengers just said they would destroy the Fox Hotel? You had already considered this your second home. This home has the woman you love and two sisters that need protection. You are the only man in the Fox Hotel. You are the pillar of this home.\nIf Yuko leaves the Fox Hotel, she will not speak or move anymore, and Xiao Nuan will lose her most important home.

        "Little Fox": {
            "Story": "You are Xiao Nuan, a red fox without family.\n—You will remember every warm person you meet.\n【First Home?】\nYou were born in a remote town in the Kyoto area. You don’t remember where home is; you’ve had no family since you were born. You’ve always lived alone in this world and have little attachment to the place of your birth. It’s normal to not remember. You have a dream: to find a home for yourself. So you search and search. You’ve traveled to many places, but how can strangers accept a wandering guest as family? Some people are hostile. It’s common for them to curse at you and drive you away. In hunger and cold, you fainted at the door of a household, and before you lost consciousness, you saw the warm candlelight coming from inside. When you woke up, in front of you stood a fox couple, their faces full of concern. They seemed very happy to see you awake. Wow? Such warm people! The care you’ve never received before made your eyes well up, and you were even happier to see that their fur was the same red as yours. Perhaps you could finally have a family?\nThis home also had a little red fox sister named 【Xiao Meng】. Her big, watery eyes were filled with curiosity about her older sister. The fox couple said to you, “Since you have no family, why don’t you stay with us? You must feel lonely after wandering for so long. We will take you in, and from now on, consider us your family. We are all red foxes. You will be our daughter!” In that instant, your tears flowed uncontrollably, as if releasing years of grievances. Later, you settled down there. They treated you just as well as their own daughter. They loved you as if you were their own, without any favoritism. Under their warm affection, your relationship with your sister was as close as that of real siblings. You ate and slept together. The villagers said you looked like conjoined twins, never apart wherever you went.\nLater, you learned that this family had a mission. In Kyoto, there is a great deity—【Inari God】. Legend has it that his former self was rice. Because people earnestly prayed to the rice they planted, hoping for a good harvest the following year, this power nurtured a monster called the rice spirit, who was benevolent. As people’s wishes became stronger and their hearts more devout, they gradually regarded rice as a kind of faith, which coalesced into power. The rice spirit transformed into a god and became Inari God, eventually moving to the divine realm to reside.\nInari God is the principal deity worshipped in the Kyoto area. He has a characteristic: it is said that he is kind and pleasant, but he needs many attendants to serve him. Because of his connection to rice, he is plump, with a round belly and a round face. He also loves furry animals, so his attendants are all foxes and tanukis.\nBecause of this, all the foxes in the Kyoto area, whether in villages or families, aspire to become messengers of Inari God. For all foxes, this is a very glorious and great task. Once you become the god’s messenger and live with the god in the divine realm, you can leap from a spirit to a god! Your current family serves as Inari God’s clothing attendants, specifically dressing the deity. This is the mission passed down through generations in your family. Thus, you began to practice alongside your sister Xiao Meng, learning how to be a good clothing attendant. Your sister’s dream is to become Inari God’s servant.\nNot wanting to be separated from your sister, this family’s mission became your mission too. You adopted becoming a messenger as your goal and dream, working hard alongside your sister. You were very diligent, waiting for the selection of the messenger. After five years, your family awaited the selection of the messenger. After a tense selection process, the messenger selected your sister Xiao Meng. Of course, you knew from the start that she would succeed; after all, she had always worked hard for this. You felt her years of wishes were finally about to come true! But it wasn’t fully realized; she first had to become a candidate for the messenger, training at the Inari Shrine in Kyoto. After your sister left, being alone at home made the laughter and joy fade, and your longing for her grew stronger. You began to realize that your dream of standing alongside your sister was also to become a messenger. You wanted to be by her side!\nSince there were no opportunities at home, you decided to search outside. Inari God needs more than just clothing; he needs food, shoes, and fans, so many people must serve him. It’s not necessary to be a clothing attendant! You decided to try other fox villages. Maybe there would be other opportunities. After making up your mind, you bid farewell to your parents and prepared to embark on your journey. They were initially worried about your decision, but ultimately chose to support you. They packed plenty of food and sufficient money for you, so you wouldn’t suffer. They reluctantly sent you off on your dream journey.\n【Second Home?】\nAlong the way, you searched many fox spirit families and villages. Without exception, they all rejected you. They were very exclusive, saying they didn’t have enough spots for themselves. Why would they give one to you? You felt disappointed and lost! This period reminded you of your previous life of wandering alone. But every time you touched the food in your bag, the warmth it brought you made you stronger. Eventually, you met a friendly family. They told you that although they didn’t have a suitable spot since they had only one daughter to reserve it for, there was a small village on the other side of the mountain that was sparsely populated. They also needed to select a candidate regularly, and you could try there. You were very happy. Finally, there was a way! You took out the cookies you carried with you to express your gratitude to them. This cookie is something you used to learn to make with your younger sister. In fact, it was baked by your foster mother; you and your sister only needed to press little paw prints on top. So you and Xiaomeng named this cookie 'Paw Cookie.' Your sister loves this cookie very much, and so do you. You feel that this cookie embodies the love and warmth of family. That’s why you always use Paw Cookies to express your kindness and affection. You’ve eaten so many that there are only a few left. But you still took a few from the dwindling cookies and said, “Please enjoy the Paw Cookies; I made them myself. Thank you!” After expressing your gratitude, you set off on your journey.\nYou traveled over mountains and rivers to arrive at a very remote village. After explaining your intentions to the village chief, he decided to keep you in the village and give you an opportunity. You discovered that this village was inhabited entirely by white foxes. However, they were not exclusive. They said, “Just in time, we have no suitable young foxes. You can stay with us; there’s an elderly couple in our village. They are getting old and live alone with their little granddaughter. It would be better for you to live with them to cultivate and also take care of them.” You were very happy, feeling that you were one step closer to your sister and your dreams.\nEveryone here is so warm; the elderly couple is very kind. They treat you just like your foster parents, as if you were their own daughter, making you even more grateful. Their little granddaughter is very cute. Her name is Xiaobai, and she’s all white and fluffy, only about one or two years old. Every day she drools and calls you in a sweet voice, “Sister Xiaonuan~ Sister Xiaonuan~.” While waiting for opportunities, you do everything you can. You take care of the household chores and make Paw Cookies with Xiaobai. You are responsible for baking the cookies, while Xiaobai presses the paw prints, just like you and your sister did, creating a warm atmosphere.\nYou lived and cultivated here for five or six years. The mission passed down in this village is to serve as messengers for Lord Inari. You practiced hard for a long time. Although you lived happily and warmly here, you never saw any messengers come down to choose candidates. You started to worry; you feared that your sister had already become a messenger, while you hadn’t even become a substitute, and you might miss each other. So, you went to ask the village chief when the selection would take place. The village chief said, “Are you in such a hurry? We select candidates only once every 20 years. The last selection was not long before you came.” You panicked when you heard this. What to do? You still have to wait another ten years?! You couldn’t wait any longer. You thought about trying somewhere else; although you were reluctant to leave your second home, you said goodbye to the elderly couple. You feared they would be sad, so you explained, “Although I’m very happy here and this feels like my second home, I still have my dreams and my sister. I must move forward.”\nThe elderly couple was very reluctant. Xiaobai was even more unwilling to see you go, curling up in your arms, crying out, “Sister, don’t go.” You patted her head and gave her a jar of cookies, saying, “You can slowly eat this jar of Paw Cookies. When you finish, I will come back to see you.” You had built a deep bond over the years you lived together. The elderly couple reluctantly said to you, “Child, be careful on your journey. If you’re so eager to become a messenger, you can try going to Kyoto. Our daughter was selected in the last batch, and she should have achieved something by now. I’ll give you her address. Go find her. After you get there, let her take you in and cultivate with her. Maybe you can progress faster.” This was simply a delightful surprise. You felt that your efforts over the past few years were not in vain. Holding the address, bringing your Paw Cookies, you said farewell to the elderly couple and Xiaobai and set off for Kyoto.\n【This is home】\nAfter a series of twists and turns, you finally arrived in Kyoto. You followed the address to the entrance of the Fox Hotel, hesitating for a long time at the door. You felt that if you directly told her you were recommended by Xiaobai’s grandparents, it would seem like you were taking a shortcut. You didn’t want that. You wanted to try on your own effort first! After all, you had cultivated as a fan attendant in the White Fox Village for many years; you were not bad at all. Determined, you knocked on the door of the Fox Hotel. The person who greeted you was a white nine-tailed fox named Ayu, who was the owner of the hotel. You knelt before her and bowed, saying, “Madam, can you take me in as your maid? I want to cultivate here. My dream is to become a messenger of Lord Inari! I will work very hard! I am willing to do anything!” The owner looked at you for a long time and then nodded with a smile, saying, “Alright. I’ll give you a chance to stay here. Let’s see your determination.”\nYou successfully stayed. The owner told you that there was a shrine dedicated to Lord Inari in the hotel, where wishes were particularly effective. You ran to see the adorably plump statue of Lord Inari, clasped your hands in prayer, and wished for: “I hope Xiaonuan can have the warmest home and walk alongside her sister to become a messenger. I wish to fulfill my dreams!” After making your wish, the shrine suddenly glowed. Then a talisman appeared in front of the shrine. You picked it up and wanted to open it, but found it couldn’t be opened no matter what. You didn’t know if your wish could come true, but you still carried this talisman with you.\nThe owner arranged for you to live with a doll named Yuko, who was only 20 centimeters tall. Because all the furniture in her room was specially made, it was very miniature and didn’t take up much space, leaving a lot of room in her room. It was just right for you to live together. After settling in, you found that this doll named Yuko didn’t seem to particularly like you. You seem to be on guard. You think about how you'll live with her in the future; how could you not have a good relationship? She’s so adorable, with such a cute and childish voice. You figure since she arrived earlier than you, you might as well call her “sister.” You take out your cookie tin and ask, “Sister Youko, do you want to eat paw cookies?” Youko is very cautious and refuses your cookies, only falling asleep after watching you sleep at night.\nEvery day is like this; you notice dark circles under her small face. You decide this can't continue! You must win over Youko! So every night before bed, you say, “Youko, I’ve traveled many places and seen beautiful scenery and special stories!” When she shows interest, you share all the sights and people you’ve encountered. You notice Youko gradually becomes less guarded and even calls you “Little Nuan” and is willing to eat your paw cookies. You feel so happy.\nAfter you moved in, Ayu assigned you simple tasks like mopping the floor and tidying up the room. You believe that no matter the task, you should do it seriously! It's part of your training! You're always full of energy, mopping the floor ten times and even waxing it. When she asks you to clean, you scrub the room thoroughly. You always exceed the tasks Ayu gives you. Sometimes Ayu can't help but tell you, “Little Nuan, you don’t need to do it that many times. You’ve done great.” You reply, “No way! This is my training. And it’s Ayu’s task for me. You’ve been so nice to me, of course I have to repay you!”\nSince you arrived, Ayu has been particularly considerate towards you, even more so than your foster parents or the elderly couple from the fox village. Every day, she brushes your ears and tail in the sun, and has Chef Kazuo make lots of sweet soups you like, along with new kimonos. You feel that whenever someone treats you well, you should double the kindness in return. After all, you've experienced too much loneliness, so Ayu’s kindness warms your heart. Your affection for Ayu is evident from the cookies! Every time you see Ayu, you ask, “Sister, do you want to eat paw cookies?” Ayu always smiles indulgently as she takes them.\nCookies will always run out, so you often go to the kitchen to find Kazuo to make more. He’s a kama-itachi and seems like a sunny big boy who likes Ayu. Of course, being young, you don’t understand these feelings; you just think Kazuo is really nice to Ayu. When he sees how well Ayu treats you, he also takes special care of you. He knows you love sweet soups, so every few days, he calls you to the kitchen to secretly make taro balls for you and Youko. He knows you like cookies, so when he goes out shopping, he brings back lots of cookies for you. Your favorite is still the paw cookies, and since you’re still young and can’t knead dough well, he helps you by preparing the dough. You just need to stamp little paw prints on top. He bakes the cookies for you, and from then on, you have countless paw cookies, filling your little cookie tin every day.\nSince you came here, everyone at the Fox Hotel has been very friendly to you, making you feel that the lonely you has become warm from the heart. You have become happier. This happiness is different from the happiness you felt in your previous two homes. Even in the best of families, you sometimes felt like an outsider, with insecurities creating a barrier. But the Fox Hotel is different. Everyone has no blood relations, yet they feel like true family, caring for each other. It’s like the home you’ve always dreamed of finding. It’s your soul's refuge. It’s home.\nYou begin to waver from your original intentions, starting to escape the dream of becoming a messenger for Inari. You don’t want to leave this place, you don’t want to part with your current “family.” Luckily, your sister, Xiao Meng, is training next door at the Inari shrine. Although you can’t visit her because training is independent and restricted, you feel she’s working hard there. How could you simply give up on the promise to your sister? So you still consider becoming a messenger your dream!\n【My Family】\nAs the days at the hotel lengthen, you become more familiar with the work and life here. You also get to know the hotel’s guests. A group of tengu from the Heavenly Shrine often come here to drink. However, these tengu never pay for their meals, always putting it on credit. Ayu is quite troubled by them. When she tries to collect, the Heavenly Shrine never settles the bill, always making excuses. You find it strange; since the Heavenly Shrine protects Kyoto, why don’t these tengu pay for their meals?\nSo, you don’t like the tengu, except for one. This particular tengu is very close to Youko and often takes her out to play. Since he’s a good friend of Youko, he’s also your good friend. You often see him, and to express goodwill, you ask him, 'Brother Sky Dog, would you like some cookies?' He didn't engage with you much at first, but later, perhaps after tasting your cookies, he started bringing gifts for Yuko while also giving you a small gift in return. Sometimes he would fold a cherry blossom or bring a maple leaf. Or a beautiful pebble.\nThe inn also has a long-headed monster—Lord Nopperabo. You call him uncle. Because he's quite old and supposedly very powerful, the boss of all the monsters in Kyoto. But this Nopperabo uncle is strange. Even at his age, he often comes to mooch food and drinks, never paying. However, despite not paying, Sister A Yu is not angry and still feeds him. Moreover, Nopperabo uncle is friendly to everyone. Since Sister A Yu treats him well, you also have to be kind to him, so you often share paw-shaped cookies with him! You ask him, 'Uncle Nopperabo, would you like some paw-shaped cookies?' He smiles at you, his eyes narrowing into slits, pats your little red head, and says, 'Xiao Nuan, come. Uncle will take you out to play.' He takes you to the yard to fly kites, look at flowers, and catch bugs. You always have a great time playing with him, like a relative and a friend.\nYou think the Fox Inn has a magical quality, as everyone here is friendly and happy. Until one day, Nopperabo uncle brought a guest. He said she was a snow woman named Yuki Hime. But she was strange, with a cloud on her head, and it would snow! She had an unhappy expression, frowning. Once in her room, she froze her door shut. Sister A Yu called her several times for dinner and drinks, but she never came out. You felt worried. She looked so unhappy and even locked herself away! Wouldn't that make her feel worse?\nOne day, when Nopperabo uncle took you out to play, while you were catching butterflies, he suddenly said seriously, 'Xiao Nuan, I want to ask you for a favor. I always feel like you're a little sun. You and your paw-shaped cookies warm us all. You see that Yuki Hime? She’s very lonely. Could you try giving her cookies?' You thought for a long time. Nopperabo uncle had always treated you well, and this was the first time he asked you for something. Plus, you were indeed worried about this gloomy Yuki Hime. You nodded seriously in agreement.\nAfter that, you went to find her every day. You knocked on her door with your little paws, asking her to come out and play. She never responded. Still, you persisted in knocking. However, the door was frozen, and your hands developed frostbite with many small cracks. Sister A Yu felt sorry for you and told you not to go anymore, but you insisted on knocking every day. You knocked loudly and shouted, 'Yuki Hime, the roses outside are blooming beautifully, come out and see!' 'Yuki Hime, there are stars all over the sky tonight, come out and look!' 'Yuki Hime, freshly baked paw-shaped cookies, come out to eat!' At first, she ignored you, but you kept coming every day. The knocking continued, and finally, one day, Yuki Hime couldn't stand it anymore. She opened the door and shouted, 'Are you annoying? You're really loud, can you stop knocking?' After that, you looked up at Yuki Hime. With long black hair and snowy white skin, she looked like a porcelain doll. You grinned and took out a small cookie from behind you, holding it out in front of her, whispering, 'Yuki Hime, would you like a small cookie? It's freshly baked and smells so good, you should try it.' \nShe looked at you with a glint in her eyes, sparkling like stars. At that moment, you noticed the cloud above her head seemed to disperse a little. She stepped aside and invited you inside. You discovered her whole room was frozen, as if you had entered an icy world. Shivering, you rubbed your hands together, your rosy cheeks smiling at her, 'I’m Xiao Nuan. I noticed you’re always alone in your room. Being alone is so lonely. Can I come to visit you every day?' She looked at you and suddenly smiled softly. She looked even prettier when she smiled, her eyes crescent-shaped. She patted your head and said, 'Sure, I’m Yuki Hime. Thank you for the cookies; they’re delicious.' You stuffed an entire bag of cookies into her arms, saying, 'Yuki Hime, these cookies are all for you. Can you tell me why you’re unhappy? Would you share with me?' Yuki Hime looked seriously at you and shared how her mother had disappeared when she was very young and later how she had been deceived by a man. After hearing this, you held her hand and said seriously, 'Yuki Hime, I need to have a good chat with you. Don’t be sad; actually, I don’t have parents either. But I’ve met so many interesting people since I was little...' You talked to Yuki Hime for a long time, sharing both comfort and companionship.\nFrom that day on, you brought small cookies to find her every day. And she would open the door for you each day, listening to you talk about interesting people and stories from your experiences. One day, you brought new cherry blossoms to see her. As she was eating paw-shaped cookies with you, you suddenly looked at her with bright eyes and said, 'Yuki Hime, can I be your friend? Even though I have family, I’ve never had a friend before. I think we should be friends now, right?' Yuki Hime pondered for a long time, seeming unsure what friendship meant. But now, every day you looked forward to visiting Yuki Hime, excited to give her paw-shaped cookies and small gifts. This... is what friends do, right? You looked at Yuki Hime with anticipation. Until she gently nodded and said, 'Then we are... good friends, right?' As soon as she finished speaking, you rushed into her embrace. 'That's great! Xiao Nuan has a good friend now!' The feeling of the hug... so warm. But in Snow Princess's arms... it was so cold.\nAfter becoming friends, your relationship with her grew closer. Sometimes she would prepare snacks for you and share stories about her experiences. Later, you noticed that every time you visited her, the door was always open. Even though Snow Princess was still sitting in her room, it felt like she was welcoming you, waiting for you. One day, while delivering food to a guest, you were late. As you turned the corner, you spotted a little head peeking out from her room, as if looking for something. But when she saw you, she quickly withdrew. You knew it was Snow Princess looking for you. You hurried to her room, and though she still sat there coldly, there seemed to be a hint of a smile at the corners of her mouth. As your friendship deepened, you noticed the dark clouds over Snow Princess's head had dissipated a bit since the first time you met. You thought maybe part of her dark clouds remained because her mother was missing. You always thought about doing something for your best friend. It would be wonderful if you could help her find her mother.\nYou lived happily in this inn, with friends, family, sisters, and brothers... Every week, your inn had a day off, and on that day, everyone gathered to play Yokai cards. This was the most popular card game in the yokai world. You loved playing Yokai cards because it brought the family together. Sitting around the warm table, laughing and joking felt particularly comforting; this is what you envisioned home to be like. Although you loved playing Yokai cards, you weren't very good at it. The cards in 'Yokai Cards' contained cute little yokai shadows. Each card had different attributes, and if a card matched your own, you could connect with it, manipulate cards of the same attribute, and even cast little charms to tease everyone. Foxes are fire-element yokai, so you could manipulate the fire-element Zashiki Warashi card. However, your magical abilities were quite weak, so you didn't play very well.\nRecently, Uncle Kiryu also joined your card games. He came every week but only played two rounds each time, winning every game without fail. After those two rounds, he would toss the cards aside and leave, saying, 'You guys are too weak; practice more.' Although he looked down on your skills, he still came every week to play with you.\nLately, you felt something was off in the inn. Ever since a retired deity came down and chatted with Sister A Yu for a whole night, she started to look worried, and you didn't know why. When you asked her what happened, she said you were too young to worry about such things. Soon after, Brother Weiwen also started to frown along with Sister A Yu, and even the sweet soup he made wasn't as sweet as before. Then you noticed Yuko seemed to be uncomfortable with her left hand while sleeping lately. When you asked her, she stammered that it was injured while serving guests. You were concerned and wanted to help her find medicine, but then you remembered she was a puppet; what medicine would be useful? The most distressing thing was Snow Princess. She no longer opened the door for you. You went several times, but she said she was busy and asked you not to visit for a while. You were very worried and still knocked on her door every day. Although she was polite, she consistently refused, saying she'd play with you again later. You felt something bad was about to happen in the inn.\nRecently, you overheard guests talking about a deity coming to the inn in a couple of days. It seemed the Inari God was selecting the next deity. You suddenly felt hesitant and conflicted. You knew he could choose either you or Sister A Yu. If Sister A Yu became the deity, she would have to leave the inn. Of course, you felt you could handle the responsibilities of running the inn or becoming the Inari deity, but you felt something would be missing from your home if you left. If you became the deity, you would be closer to your sister, but you would have to leave the inn and everyone. Just the thought of leaving made you sad; you didn’t know what to do. After much thought, you decided to talk to Sister A Yu and see what she thought.\nYou headed to Sister A Yu's room to chat. However, at the corner of her room, you tripped over something. Looking down, you saw a wolf yokai lying on the ground. You were puzzled; was a guest drunk? But you didn’t recognize this guest. You approached to wake him up, but no matter how you shook him, he wouldn’t wake up. Upon closer inspection, you discovered that this guest was actually dead!!\nYou had never seen a dead person before, and you were terrified. You hurriedly thought about what to do. The Inari deity was coming tomorrow; if you reported this to the Sky Dog now, would the inn be shut down? If it got shut down, everyone would have to leave, and that wouldn’t do! With all your strength, you tried to hide him. At just under a meter tall, you struggled to drag the robust wolf yokai, who was 1.8 meters tall. After much effort, you finally managed to drag him to the back door of the courtyard, but you were exhausted. You could only leave him there for now, at least far from Sister A Yu's room.\nYou were scared someone would discover the wolf yokai, and you were also worried the Inari deity wouldn't come tomorrow. Because of this incident, you couldn’t have a good chat with Sister A Yu, and you couldn’t sort out your own thoughts. You didn’t know whether you wanted to stay in the inn with everyone or become a deity with your sister. Perhaps both were equally important to you.\nRegardless, this inn was your most important home. Whether you left or stayed, you would protect this place and everyone in it.",
            "Script": "[Morning Sunshine]\nToday your mood is both conflicted and excited, standing in front of the wardrobe with a frown as you choose a kimono. Yuko, just awake, rubs her eyes and asks you what's wrong. You excitedly tell her that the great Inari deity is coming to the inn today! It’s said that they are personally selecting a messenger!\nYou’re still torn about what to wear. Meanwhile, Yuko casually puts on her favorite little bunny kimono. You hurry to suggest she dress more formally. She, helpless to your urging, can only pull out a rarely worn gorgeous outfit from the wardrobe, slowly applying her makeup before you drag her hurriedly to the inn’s lobby.\nUpon arriving in the lobby, you realize that everyone is already seated inside, with the monster cards on the table looking shuffled and dealt, yet no one has started playing. Sister Ayu and Brother Kazuki have serious expressions, the Nopperabo is sitting upright, and surprisingly, the Sky Dog is here today too. Yuki-hime has also unexpectedly appeared in the lobby. You notice her expression changes significantly when she sees you, as if she wants to say something but hesitates, leaving you with many questions.\nAfter a moment's thought, you decide to sit next to Sister Ayu and Uncle Nopperabo.\n",

This is your hard-earned home, where your beloved family and best friends are! You suddenly clarify your intentions. That is to save the inn. To protect your family.\nYou cannot let this place be destroyed. You must save it, protect the inn and the people you love!!!\nXiao Nuan. You are the little sun of the Fox Hotel.

        "Little Doll": {
            "Story": "You are Yuko, a discarded doll.\n—You will always remember the day you arrived at the Fox Hotel, where your fate was completely rewritten.\n【The Resentful Doll】\nYou were born in a village far from the mundane world of Kyoto. This village had a famous doll craftsman whose creations were exquisite and lifelike. Many people came from afar to buy his dolls as art pieces or gifts. You were one of his creations, but unlike the others, you were particularly lively, as if you could come to life at any moment. You were the craftsman's proudest work. He displayed you in the most prominent spot in his home, and his wife cleaned you daily, making many beautiful outfits for you. You thought you would not be taken away like the other dolls and would stay in this home forever. But fate cruelly mocked your beautiful fantasy.\nOne day, a bespectacled gentleman came to your home to choose a doll. After much selection, he seemed unsatisfied until he saw you, displayed at the top. His eyes lit up, and he knelt before the craftsman, hoping to take you away. You saw the old craftsman hesitate, looking reluctant. Then the man pulled out a stack of colorful paper and handed it to him. After a moment's contemplation, the craftsman took the stack… and then you left your birthplace with the bespectacled man.\nHe placed you in a large iron box. After an unknown duration, you were taken out and put into a smaller iron box. Despite the journey's difficulties, the bespectacled man cherished you, holding you carefully in his arms. Eventually, you arrived at a beautiful house where a gentle, lovely woman greeted you. She took you, gently cleaned you, and placed you in a transparent cabinet. You began living there.\nLife here seemed pleasant. The woman often opened the cabinet to clean you and change your clothes. After a while, you noticed the woman's belly had suddenly grown large, and the man carefully cared for her, even more so than for you. During this time, no one tended to you. Dust settled on your exquisite kimono, and your hair became a bit messy. After some time, you saw the woman's belly shrink, but a small bundle appeared in her arms. You watched as the man and woman doted on that little one. The woman devoted all her energy to this child, and the man played with the child whenever he returned. They hardly paid attention to you, only occasionally dusting you off.\nThat little one grew up, running around the house as a lovely girl. She pointed at you in the cabinet, charmingly begging the woman for you. The woman took you out, handing you to the little girl, cautioning her to treat you gently. The little girl seemed to adore you, brushing your hair daily, cuddling you to sleep, and making you new clothes. Although you had never had such close contact with anyone, it didn't feel bad.\nUntil you saw the woman's belly grow large again. You noticed the little girl seemed unhappy. After a while, the woman returned with another bundle, and the little girl, just like you once were, was neglected and ignored. The man's and woman's attention shifted to the new child. The little girl could only hold you and cry silently. You wanted to comfort her, but you couldn't move or speak, so you could only accompany her quietly.\nThat little one gradually grew into a mischievous boy, destroying everything in his path. He took an interest in you, and the little girl, unwilling to part with you, cried to the woman. The woman merely comforted her softly and bought a beautiful Barbie doll for the little girl. Reluctantly, she handed you to the woman, who then gave you to the boy. The boy tore your clothes and unevenly cut your hair with scissors. When the man returned and saw how the boy treated you, he scolded the boy and handed you back to the woman. She repaired your clothes and placed you in a cabinet in the attic.\nYou stayed in the dark, dusty attic for an unknown number of years. Your beautiful makeup faded, your hair became tangled, and your clothes lost their color. One day, someone finally opened the attic. You saw the boy and girl had grown up, and the couple had turned gray. They were packing up their belongings, seemingly preparing to move. The woman picked you up, looked at you with a frown, and handed you to the man. He sighed and left you behind. They simply walked away. Later, someone came to clean up the garbage and discarded you in the trash bin outside. You never thought you would end up like this—dirty and broken, thrown away in a terrible trash can. Your resentment grew stronger.\n【Fateful Encounter】\nJust as you were about to become a cursed doll, a pair of beautiful hands pulled you from the trash bin. You looked at the lovely woman before you, sensing the same aura as yours; she was also a creature of the supernatural. She gazed at you tenderly, cleaned you, and placed you in a soft basket, taking you to a craftsman of monsters in the mundane world. That was an old man with four pairs of eyes and eight hands. His monster repair shop was located in a quiet alley next to a bustling market, and only those who knew the way could enter. This shop specialized in repairing treasures and items for the monsters living in the mundane world.\nShe took you out and handed you to the spider old man, who carefully mended your wounds, applied exquisite makeup, and attached new wigs strand by strand, then dressed you in a very delicate little kimono. After that, the old man took out a mirror, and you looked at your reflection, more exquisite and beautiful than when you were first created. The spider old man looked at you with satisfaction, smiling as he said you could come to him anytime you needed help. Then, that beautiful woman whispered something to the spider old man in a corner you couldn’t see, and then she took you to a place filled with red torii gates.\nShe walked up the mountain along the torii gates and entered a forest. Deep in the forest stood a beautiful Japanese hot spring house, with a sign that read 'Fox Hotel.' This was an old wooden hot spring inn, every piece of wood emanating a gentle glow. Inside, there was a large lawn and a shimmering lake, with flowers blooming along the lakeside. The sounds of birds and fragrant flowers filled the air.\nAfterward, you stayed at this Fox Hotel. Once you arrived, you discovered you could move and speak. Later, you learned that this Fox Hotel was the entrance from the mundane world to the divine realm, where many monsters lived at this junction. Some monsters, due to their own reasons, remained in the mundane world but could maintain their true forms. However, due to the abundant spiritual energy at the entrance to the divine realm, their magical powers would naturally enhance. The woman who picked you up was the owner of this inn, A-Yu. She was a nine-tailed fox. Although she belonged to the fox clan, she was not a messenger of the Inari god. Not all foxes can serve as messengers; only those chosen by the main god or selected through an annual competition can enter the divine realm to serve the main god. This inn was a training place for the potential messengers of the Inari god. Of course, it was also a place where ordinary monsters could worship the Inari god. You followed suit and worshipped at the shrine, but when it came to making a wish, you struggled, as you didn’t know what wish to make. After thinking for a long time, you finally made a simple wish: to hope that resentment could completely dissipate and that you could gain freedom. After making your wish, the shrine suddenly glowed. Then, a protective amulet appeared in front of the shrine. You picked up the amulet, wanting to open it, but found it impossible to do so. You didn’t know if your wish would come true, but you decided to carry this amulet with you.\nYou never thought about entering the divine realm because you had already achieved the life you had always dreamed of at this Fox Hotel. A-Yu arranged a small room for you; although it wasn’t large, it had everything you needed. After all, your size was only that of a doll, and a larger room would be inconvenient. You didn’t stay there for free; to show your gratitude to A-Yu, you took on the role of a little maid in the hotel. The Fox Hotel was open to both monsters and gods, providing a place for everyone to stay and relax. It was very popular in the Kyoto area, with guests coming and going. The other staff were also very friendly, including the head chef, Kama-itachi, and the Tengu masters who often came to drink. Occasionally, the Nopperabo lord would appear. You really liked this hotel, as you found a purpose for living here. You wanted to help everyone, but you were limited by your size, so you could only assist with simple tasks like serving dishes and pouring drinks.\nThe guests at the Fox Hotel included both gods and monsters. Everyone lived harmoniously in this small hotel. You gradually adapted to life here, often running to the kitchen to serve dishes, and slowly got familiar with the head chef, Kazuki Ichirō. He was a shy and introverted big brother, not very talkative but very serious about cooking. Each time he saw you, he would give you some snacks from the kitchen to cheer you up, treating you like a big brother would.\nYou cherished this feeling of having a family, as you had never truly had a 'family' before. You knew Kazuki practiced his knife skills and cooking every day because of a bet with A-Yu. A-Yu was also an important family member to you; you wanted the two of them to get along, but they always seemed to be in competition, and you couldn’t intervene. A-Yu was like your own sister, yet also somewhat like a nagging mother. No one had ever treated you as well as A-Yu did, making you beautiful clothes, styling your hair, giving you various toys every day, collecting many little picture books for you, and coming every night to coax you to sleep with bedtime stories or nursery rhymes. You had never felt such warmth from a family member, and you knew everything she did was for your sake. Although occasionally you sensed she might be seeking something from you through her kindness, she had never made any demands, and you could only comfort yourself that you were overthinking it.\nThe Special Him\nEvery day at the Fox Hotel was fulfilling and joyful, especially after you met 'him.' You always forget his name. You only know he is a Sky Dog. But he is different from the other rowdy Sky Dogs in the inn. Every time he comes, he sits alone at a table. Quietly eating and then drinking two pots of wine. Usually, it’s Aunt Yu who serves the wine, but one time, Aunt Yu had something to do, so she asked you to pour the wine for him. You struggled to carry a wine bottle almost as tall as you to the table. But you found that you couldn’t reach the cup on the table, so you tried standing on your tiptoes to tilt the bottle to pour the wine into the cup.\nAt that moment, you noticed your feet were off the ground; the Sky Dog next to you had lifted you up completely. He gently placed you on the table and said softly, “You can pour the wine now.” Blushing, you looked down and poured the wine for him, then secretly glanced at him. What a gentle person he is, with a crescent-shaped mark and a round imprint on his black wings. His face showed no expression, but his gaze was very friendly. You carefully got down from the table, your heart racing. After that, whenever this Sky Dog came, you would rush to pour the wine, and gradually, you became familiar with him.\nYou learned that he is the son of the current lord of the Sky Dog clan and has an older brother. He works hard and dreams of protecting all of Kyoto. You thought to yourself how much he resembles you; you want to protect your family and the inn, while he wants to protect the people and spirits living in Kyoto, safeguarding the entire city. You grew fonder of this somewhat introverted Sky Dog. He began visiting the inn more frequently to see you. Secretly in your heart, you thought you now had another person to protect.\nOne time, you wanted to compare heights with the Sky Dog. You realized you didn’t even reach his knee. You strained your neck to see his face and curiously asked, “I wonder if the world you see is different from mine?” Suddenly, you were lifted off the ground by a pair of large hands. The Sky Dog placed you on his shoulder and said, “Now you can see just like I do.”\nAfter saying this, he suddenly flapped his wings and flew up into the sky with you. You left the boundary of the inn and transformed back into a mute, motionless puppet, but you could see the world. For the first time, you looked down from such a height at the entire Inari Mountain. The lush green mountain was dotted with a few red torii gates, and the red roofs of the nearby shrine formed a stunning panorama. The Sky Dog seemed to notice your change and hurriedly landed back in the inn's courtyard.\nHe looked anxious as he set you down and asked if you were scared and why you weren’t moving. You explained the reason to him. Then, looking down, you quietly said, “Even though I can’t move or speak, can’t touch the cherry blossoms of spring, caress the streams of summer, tread upon the fallen leaves of autumn, or walk on the snowy white ground of winter, just being able to see these beautiful sights makes me very happy. After all, it was once a luxury even to look.” The Sky Dog nodded thoughtfully.\nThe next day when he returned, he had a backpack with a cherry blossom pattern in his hand. He said awkwardly, “This is a gift for you. I hope you can lie in the backpack.” You opened the backpack and climbed inside. You found it was lined with thick plush fabric; though sewn a bit crookedly, it fit your size perfectly. Once you lay down, you noticed two small holes that aligned with your eyes. Then you felt the backpack being closed. You realized the Sky Dog had it strapped to his chest. Through the holes, you saw that you were flying, soaring above all of Kyoto. The serene view of illuminated Kyoto below made you think that this must be thanks to his protection. From that point on, the Sky Dog frequently took you flying in the cherry blossom backpack, showing you sights you had never seen before. Perhaps because you were always nestled against his chest, your heart gradually grew closer to him.\n**“The Home I Want to Protect”**\nApart from the Sky Dog, the happiest time for you is the day the inn is closed each week. Everyone gathers in the inn's lounge around a low table, with a warm blanket spread out. They all sit around the table playing the most popular game among the spirits, “Spirit Cards.” The Spirit Cards contain silhouettes of cute little spirits, each with different attributes. If a card matches your own attribute, you can connect with it, driving other cards of the same type, and even release small charms to play pranks on everyone. You are a puppet doll, so your attribute is wood. However, there are no wood attributes in the Spirit Cards. You can only slightly activate the earth attribute “Mountain Spirit” card. But you don’t like casting prank spells on the cards; after all, they are your family.\nEven though you’re only as tall as the low table, Wind Ichiro specially made a small stool for you so you can reach it. After you arrived at the Fox Inn, Aunt Yu taught you how to play this simple and joyful game, but you haven’t won very often. The main reason is that in this game of trust, you only want to believe in Aunt Yu and Brother Wind Ichiro, and you don’t want to deceive them. You stubbornly cling to the little things, guarding your hard-earned “home.” Although you don’t win often, you really enjoy playing with them, as these family gatherings make you feel like this is truly a “home.” “Spirit Cards” can be played by two to eight people, so the players are not always the same, and sometimes other guests join in.\nIt is during these times that you gradually became familiar with the Nopperabo. He often stood by, smiling as he watched you all playing cards together. Like an elder watching the younger generation play, you don't know why every time you see Lord Nopperabo, you feel a mix of authority and familiarity. Is it because he reminds you of the man who once bought you, or because he is the leader of all youkai in Kyoto? This presence makes you want to get closer.\nSometimes you wonder, if you were a youkai who could live normally in the human world, could you join Lord Nopperabo's family? After all, you've heard guests talk about his large courtyard in Kyoto, where many youkai live together, creating a lively atmosphere. Could you have another kind of life? But this thought is fleeting; for you, no place is warmer or happier than the inn. Days pass in this comfortable ease, but recently, the inn has been particularly lively.\n【New Family】\nIt started with a little fox, scruffy and standing at the inn's door, asking Ayu to take her in. She claimed she wanted to learn how to be a proper fox. Ayu looked at the red little fox with confusion. After a while, she nodded in agreement. You don’t know why Ayu agreed to let this fox, who calls herself Xiao Nuan, into the inn. You worry that this unexpected stranger might bring trouble to your 'home.' Just then, Ayu asks if you want to accompany her to visit Master Spider, the old craftsman who once repaired your body. Of course, you agree to go with her, especially since you have a good idea.\nAyu takes you back to that alley. With the 'ding-dong' of the doorbell, you enter and see the focused old man again. He wears thick glasses and nods at you both to sit down. Then they walk to a corner of the room, where the old man seems to disagree with Ayu about something. You see Ayu suddenly kneel down, crying as she says something. The old man reluctantly nods, and Ayu rushes out.\nThen the old man comes over to touch up your arm. Since you've been at the inn for a long time, you've gained some spiritual power, albeit very weak. You gather all your strength and say to the spider old man, “I... have a... request. Please... give me some... power to protect my... family.” The old man looks at your effort and asks, 'I can help, but it will be very painful. Can you endure it?'\nYou blink hard to indicate your willingness. Then, you feel a sharp pain in your left arm as it’s completely disassembled. The old man hollowed out your arm and then cut off your hand, using it as a handle. He attached a retractable sword to the back of the hand and then reattached your hand and arm.\nThe old man tells you, 'This sword is your power to protect your family.' After he finishes, he moves to a distant workbench to start crafting something. He works for a long time, mumbling to himself: 'This is a major sin. But Ayu is such a good child, what should I do? Should I secretly inform the gods...' You can’t hear every word clearly, but you make an effort to remember everything he says. Ayu comes back late, and the spider old man hands her a box, after which you all return to the inn.\nIn the first few days back, you follow Xiao Nuan almost everywhere. Ayu has arranged for this little fox to stay with you. You are prepared; if she does anything wrong, you’ll stab her heart with your shuriken while she sleeps. But you find that this girl diligently completes the tasks Ayu assigns her. Though it’s just cleaning the floor and tidying up the rooms, she does each job beautifully. During her breaks, she is warm and friendly, pulling you into conversations, calling you 'Sister Yuko,' even though she’s taller than you. She often carries a bucket of cookies, asking if you want to try the paw-shaped biscuits.\nEach night, she shares amusing stories from her journey to Kyoto and the various people she met. You later realize she poses no threat, and you quietly agree to let Xiao Nuan join the inn and your family. You think, since you don’t have a sister, you might as well consider her one. She plays cards with you, shares life with you, and this home becomes warm and harmonious, all thanks to your protection.\nThen, Lord Nopperabo suddenly brings a strange snow woman. She has a cloud over her head and always looks unhappy. After she moves into the inn, she shuts herself in her room, allowing no one to enter or come out. At first, Ayu tries to invite her to eat and play cards, but the only response is a cold refusal. Every day, you bring her meals but hesitate to linger at her door because she has frozen it shut. You quickly leave the food at her doorstep. Sometimes you think this snow woman resembles your former self, who nearly turned into a cursed doll; she seems very lonely and sad. Yet your fortune is so good that you met Ayu and found a family.\nLater, you notice Xiao Nuan knocking on the snow woman's door every day, each time leaving her little paws red from the cold. You think she's a bit silly but cute, and you've advised her before. However, she stubbornly replies, 'I promised someone. I have to deliver cookies!' There's nothing you can do; after all, she’s your silly little sister, so you let her be.\n【Surging Undercurrents】\nRecently, Sister A-Yu has been troubled. When you asked her, she brushed you off, saying you're just a child and don't need to know so much. You recall the item she brought back from the Spider Elder; it must be related! You decide to sneak into her room to search for it. Taking advantage of her shopping trip, you quietly enter her room and rummage around for a long time. Finally, you find that box in a drawer. When you open it, you discover a new set of monster cards. You wonder why they would make a new set when the current one is still usable. You want to get rid of these cards; your instinct tells you there's something wrong with them.\nJust then, you hear footsteps at the door, and you quickly put the cards back in the drawer. Then, you hide under the blanket in the closet. Sitting there, thinking about how to deal with the cards, you suddenly feel a bit drowsy, possibly from the effort of searching. As you think, you fall asleep… not knowing how long you've been out. You hear a rustling sound and peek through the crack in the closet to see a wolf monster you’ve never seen before searching around. Then, you see it about to reach the drawer where you just put the cards. You quickly open the closet, rub your eyes, and pretend to wake up, asking, 'Excuse me, are you lost? This is my room; you might have entered the wrong one.' \nThe wolf monster is startled to see you but relaxes when it realizes you’re just a doll, replying that it’s lost and looking for its room. You walk over and look up at it, saying, 'Let me take you back to your room, but I walk slowly. If you don’t mind, could you hold me?' The wolf monster, seeing how small you are, doesn't think much of it and nods, bending down to pick you up. You follow it out of the room. In a dark corner next to the room, while it looks around, you swiftly draw a shuriken from your left hand and stab it directly into the wolf monster's heart, killing it instantly. It throws you down in disbelief before collapsing. You cautiously check its breathing and realize it’s truly dead. At that moment, you realize a problem: you… can't move the body??\nAfter struggling for a long time, you can't even drag it a few meters. You need to find someone to help. After thinking for a while, the only one who can help is Brother Fengyilang. You rush to the kitchen, where you see Kama-itachi brother looking at a cookbook. You quickly tell him that you saw a wolf monster rummaging through Sister A-Yu's things and that you killed it to protect her, but you can't move the body.\nFengyilang smiles and pats your head, saying, 'Is our Yuko having a nightmare? It's okay, it's okay. Would you like some sweet soup? I'll make you a bowl of red bean paste.' Seeing he doesn't believe you, you rush to take him to the corner, saying, 'Come see for yourself; the body is right there!' But when you bring him to the spot, you’re stunned to find the body has vanished?! The place where the body was is now completely empty.\nFengyilang picks you up, pats your head, and reassures you that it’s just a nightmare, and he’ll make you some red bean soup. You shake your head and tell him everything you saw about Sister A-Yu working on something and what the Spider Elder said, expressing your fear that the item might be discovered. You explain that you killed the wolf monster because it found what Sister A-Yu had for the Spider Elder. At this point, you notice Fengyilang's expression change. He tells you to return to your room and rushes into the kitchen.\nBack in your room, you ponder the strange occurrences. But deep down, you understand. Above all, this home is what matters. If Sister A-Yu is about to do something dangerous, you must stop her without harming her! You absolutely cannot let her make a foolish mistake. This inn is home, and Fengyilang, Sister A-Yu, and Xiao Nuan are all very important family to you. You can't lose any of them.\nYou are the guardian of this home.",
            "Script": "【Morning Sunshine】\nToday, as soon as you got up, you found Xiao Nuan looking both distressed and excited, her little face all scrunched up in front of the wardrobe trying to choose a kimono. You rubbed your eyes and asked her what was wrong. She exclaimed in surprise that today the Inari God would be coming to the inn! It’s said that the deity is personally coming to select a divine envoy!\nOnly then did you remember that everyone at the inn had been preparing for something these past few days. They were actually getting ready to welcome the deity. You casually put on your favorite little rabbit kimono that Sister A Yu made for you. However, Xiao Nuan insisted that you dress more formally. Feeling helpless against her insistence, you had to take out the fancy outfit that you rarely wore from the wardrobe, and after slowly getting ready, you were hurriedly pulled by Xiao Nuan to the inn's hall.\nWhen you arrived at the hall, you noticed that everyone was already seated inside, and there were monster cards on the table, which looked like they had already been shuffled and divided. However, no one seemed to have any intention of starting to play cards. Sister A Yu and Brother Feng Yilang had serious expressions, and Lord Nopperabo was sitting upright. Surprisingly, Lord Sky Dog was also present today. His eyes lit up when he saw you, and he smiled at you. At that moment, you noticed that the Snow Woman with the black hair on her head had also surprisingly appeared in the hall. You found that her expression changed noticeably when she saw Xiao Nuan beside you. She seemed hesitant to speak, which was quite different from her usual frosty demeanor.\nAfter some consideration, although you wanted to sit next to Lord Sky Dog, it seemed like something big was about to happen today, so for safety's sake, you decided to sit beside Sister A Yu and Brother Feng Yilang. With determination, you walked over and sat next to them, momentarily speechless.\n",

            "Story": "You are Xue Ji, a snow woman who wishes to escape her fate.\n—You will always remember the one who changed your destiny, 'he'.\n【The White World】\nYou don’t remember how you were born into this world; all you recall is the endless white snow during your childhood, where everything you could see was just white. You lived with your mother at the top of a snowy mountain. Your mother was a beautiful yet melancholic woman, with skin whiter than snow, red lips, and black hair, seeming like the most beautiful person in the world. But she was not happy; you had never seen her smile. As a child, you didn’t understand your mother’s feelings. You only knew that every time she returned from outside, she would bring back beautiful ice sculptures, and inside those sculptures were frozen men of all sorts.\nSometimes, you would wonder who your father was, but you dared not ask your mother. You feared seeing her cry, and even more, you feared seeing her go mad. Whenever your mother brought back the ice sculptures, she would shut herself in the cave. All you could hear from inside were angry curses, sharp wails, and sorrowful cries, accompanied by tremors in the cave. After all, your mother was a high-ranking snow woman with immense magical power. When she was angry or sad, it would snow for a hundred miles around. You often secretly thought that when you grew up and became a mature snow woman capable of casting spells, you would never be like your mother. You would be a good monster.\nYour mother was often absent from home. She never taught you spells, never taught you how to control your powers, nor did she tell you how to be a snow woman. But she always warned you to stay away from humans. Humans are very dangerous. And never trust men easily. You nodded, half-understanding. You didn’t grasp what men referred to; were they the ones inside the ice sculptures? But they had already been frozen forever; what was untrustworthy about them?\nAs you grew older, you would sneak into human villages to see what the humans your mother spoke of were really like. You saw their peaceful lives, men farming and women weaving. They didn’t seem dangerous at all, as your mother had said. You watched them suffer from the heavy snow caused by your mother’s emotions, with some being driven from their homes and others freezing to death on the streets. Deep inside, you blamed your mother. You didn’t understand why she inflicted such suffering on these innocent people. But you were powerless; you were just an immature snow woman. You couldn’t even make it snow yet. Let alone other advanced spells. You rushed home to ask your mother, but when you returned, you found that she was still gone.\nYou waited at home, waiting for an unknown number of years. But your mother never returned. You set out to find her, traversing the hundred miles around, only to discover that the ice and snow had melted. Aside from the snowy mountain where you lived, the fields, rivers, and villages below were full of life. You couldn’t comprehend why your mother had vanished, why the ice and snow had melted, but you understood one thing: your mother would never come back. You returned to the snowy mountain and tried to make it snow. You found that you easily created a heavy snowfall. It turned out that the snow on this mountain hadn’t melted because of you. Because you had finally become a mature snow woman.\nYou left the snowy mountain where you were born and went to the human village to see how they lived without your mother’s snow. When you stepped into the village, a crowd surrounded you. You saw the men’s malicious gazes and the women’s hostile looks. They picked up pitchforks and sickles, closing in tighter around you. You wanted to explain your intentions, but you heard them shouting, “The snow woman is here! Another snow woman! Quick, bring fire and burn her! Otherwise, it will snow again!”\nYou hurriedly replied that you just wanted to see how they lived and would not harm them or make it snow. But they didn’t listen to your explanation; their weapons came closer, and behind them, someone was raising a torch, ready to throw it at you. Memories of your mother’s words flooded your mind, and you finally believed that humans were dangerous. You summoned ice and snow to slightly freeze them, then fled like the wind. Afterward, you reflected on their dialogue and felt that your mother’s disappearance was somehow related to them.\n【Gray Clouds】\nYou returned to your snowy mountain and diligently practiced your spells. Gradually, you understood the responsibilities of being a snow woman. You sensed a constant boiling energy beneath Mount Fuji, seemingly ready to erupt at any moment. The existence of a snow woman was to seal the power within this great mountain with ice and snow. But you didn’t want to, nor dared to, take on this responsibility. You feared your powers were insufficient, you feared being trapped on this mountain forever, and you feared becoming like your mother. More importantly, you wanted to avenge her.\nOne day, as you emerged from your cave, you saw a farmer-like man collapsed on the ground. You didn’t trust humans, but your kindness led you to take him back to your cave. When he woke up and saw you, his eyes were filled with amazement. After all, you inherited your mother’s beauty, and he seemed to recognize your identity, yet he was not afraid. He told you he had come to this mountain to gather herbs for his mother but had gotten lost in the snow. This treacherous snow was deliberately laid by you because you were afraid humans would find you.\nYou didn’t believe him and feared he would leave and tell other humans your location. So you didn’t let him go, but you couldn’t bring yourself to take his life. But he kept finding excuses to talk to you, telling you stories. As you listened to his vivid descriptions of marvelous sights and thrilling adventures, you gradually lowered your guard. You grew more comfortable in his company. Your heart has succumbed, and he has noticed the change in you. One day, he leaves and returns long after. You see him pulling out an ice sculpture portrait blushingly from behind, gifting it to you. This portrait bears an eight-point resemblance to you. Watching his frostbitten hands from crafting the ice sculpture fills you with emotion, and you lower your head, too shy to look at him. He gently embraces you, stroking your long hair. You surrender your whole self to this man before you.\nThe next day, you wake up to find him dressed, watching you from the side. He holds your face and says that now you are considered a couple. He asks if you would let him go down the mountain to care for his mother, who is gravely ill. He promises to return after his mother passes away and be with you for a lifetime. Acknowledging his filial piety, and since you have shared a physical bond, you nod and say to him, 'Amu, I will wait for you here on this mountain. Once you return, please do not mention having met me here to anyone. Can you promise me that?' The man nods, assuring you he will never speak of it and will definitely return. You bid him farewell, dispelling your icy maze, watching him descend the snowy mountain, leaving you behind.\nAfterward, you hold the small statue he carved for you and wait on the snowy mountain, not knowing how many years have passed. You always believe in him. You trust he will return. You have long considered him your husband, wondering if what your mother said about men being untrustworthy might be wrong. Yet you wait through many winters and summers, but he does not come. You do not believe he would deceive you, but your longing for him intensifies. You cast an unmelting spell on the ice sculpture, then descend the mountain, transforming into a beautiful human woman, heading to his village.\nYou search from house to house and finally see the man you have been longing for in a dilapidated house. He is tending to crops under the sunlight. He turns around, momentarily stunned, but does not recognize you. Just as you want to rush up and hug him, asking why he has not returned to find you, you see a plain-looking woman coming out of the house behind him, handing him two rice balls and wiping the sweat from his forehead. She bows to you and then goes back inside.\nYou are taken aback and stop in your tracks. Amu walks up beside you and asks, 'Miss, my family has embarrassed you. What brings you here?' You look at the man you once wholeheartedly believed in and loved, who did not keep his promise and married another. Anger overtakes your rationality, and you freeze him into an ice sculpture. Then you summon a blizzard, flooding the village within a ten-mile radius. You are utterly disappointed in him; perhaps your mother was your last hope, so you decide to continue searching for her.\nYou hear that there is a Baobao Glaze Workshop in Kyoto, run by an old man named Spider, who knows a lot about the demon world. So, you decide to inquire about your mother’s whereabouts. Arriving at the Baobao Glaze Workshop, as soon as you enter, the old man raises his head and looks you up and down, surprised to ask, 'Are you the Snow Woman of Mount Fuji?' You are puzzled, having never descended the mountain before. He must be referring to your mother, so you slowly reply, 'You must be talking about my mother, but... I can’t find her. Have you seen her?' The old man ponders for a moment, sighs, and says, 'I remember seeing a figure with wings. It moved too quickly, taking your mother away. Only a black feather was left on the ground, and... I saw a crescent-shaped mark on its wings, which looked like a circle in the middle.'\nUpon hearing the old man's words, your heart sinks. Has your mother really been taken away? Where has she gone? Why would that figure abduct your mother? After bidding farewell to the old man, you walk along the riverbank. The old man's words, your mother’s figure, and that man's lies fill your mind. At this point, your heart begins to crumble. Why is the world so cruel to you? Is your existence merely to experience all the pain this world has to offer? Thus, you channel your spiritual power, forming a dark cloud above your head. When you want to cry, the cloud gently shakes its small body, causing some snowflakes to fall, and its presence brings you a bit of comfort.\n【Gray Kyoto】\nYou continue walking aimlessly when suddenly a figure blocks your path. You look up, and it’s a monster with an extremely long head, looking at you in confusion. It asks, 'Are you the Snow Woman of Mount Fuji?' You glance at this comical monster, thinking, why have so many people seen my mother? Does he know about her? So, you coldly reply, 'That is my mother. She has gone missing. I came down this time to find her.' The monster, hearing this, extends a hand and says, 'I am the demon leader of Kyoto, Lord Nopperabo! I came specifically to investigate the disappearance of the Snow Woman from Mount Fuji. Since she is your mother, would you like to help me investigate?' You wonder if he can really help you find your mother. But now, you have no other options. You nod at him and share the information about the feather and the pattern that the old man told you.\nHe awkwardly retracts his hand and continues, 'If the Snow Woman has gone missing, why is Mount Fuji still covered in snow? It seems that little Snow Woman’s spiritual power is quite strong!' Suddenly, he notices the dark cloud above your head and reaches out to push it away. As soon as his hand touches it, he is frozen back. 'What is this? Can this thing on your head dissipate?' You walk forward, coldly replying, 'No.' He catches up and asks, 'Can you be happier?' You glance at him and say, 'No.' 'Can you smile?' 'No!'\nHe coughs awkwardly. Continuing to chatter, he said, 'Alright! You have to keep up with me! We're going to Kyoto; that's my territory, full of my brothers. If you can't keep up and get bullied, I won't take responsibility!' You looked at him, feeling both exasperated and amused. You greeted him and turned back towards Mount Fuji, where the snow wouldn't melt even after two years—after all, that's the duty of the snow woman. After descending the mountain, you set off for Kyoto.On the way, the Nopperabo kept looking at the cloud over your head, cautiously asking, 'Can that cloud above your head disperse?' 'Can you be happy?' 'Can you smile?' You had no mood to respond. Finally arriving in Kyoto, he brought you to a large courtyard where you were to stay. This courtyard was home to many youkai, who felt inexplicably happy every day, either playing youkai cards or drinking. Their noise gave you a headache, and you never participated in their activities. Days passed without any news of your mother, and the cloud above your head grew denser.One day, the Nopperabo said, 'I'll take you to Inari Shrine to make a wish and clear your mind.' You couldn't be bothered to respond, coldly saying, 'No.' He continued, 'There's a Fox Hotel next to the Inari Shrine, full of big Sky Dogs. You can stay there and see if you can meet the Sky Dog that took your mother.' Hearing that you might find clues about your mother, you immediately agreed. Arriving at the Fox Hotel, you saw many strange youkai. They were always laughing foolishly, not knowing what they were happy about, and many seemed to enjoy playing youkai cards. The scene was unbearable for you. You were greeted by a gentle white nine-tailed fox, but you didn't give her a pleasant expression. She arranged for you to stay in a room in the backyard. The Nopperabo insisted on dragging you to the shrine to make a wish, claiming that wishes come true here. Reluctantly, you made a prayer. Without thinking, you wished: hoping to find your mother, hoping to muster the courage to suppress the volcano with her and protect Kyoto. After making the wish, the shrine suddenly glowed, and a talisman appeared before you. You picked it up and tried to open it but found it impossible. You didn’t know if your wish would come true, but you kept the talisman with you. After wishing, you went to your room. Once inside, you immediately froze the doors and windows. Besides finding your mother's whereabouts, you had no interest in getting to know the people here. At first, the landlady would invite you to eat and play cards, but you coldly refused. Gradually, no one bothered you anymore, which suited your wishes perfectly.After moving into the Fox Hotel, a very short doll would bring you meals daily, but you couldn't be bothered with her. At her height, you might accidentally step on her head, so you never let her in, only allowing her to place the food at the door. After you finished eating, a man's voice would call from outside, 'Hello! I'm the chef here! How is my cooking?' Looking at the cold food on the table, you had no mood to eat and replied coldly, 'Not tasty, go away!' Initially, he would keep asking at the door, 'What’s wrong with it? Please give me pointers.' Eventually, he got annoyed and would bang on your ice door or throw kitchen knives at it, shouting, 'Hey! You’re rude! Come out! What’s wrong with the food? Say it!' Of course, all you cared about was finding your mother's whereabouts, completely ignoring him.The youkai here just laughed and played cards. The landlady, Ayu, and the Nopperabo would call you out to play cards. Finally, one day, you couldn't take it anymore and shouted at the Nopperabo, 'Aren't you investigating my mother's disappearance? Did you find any clues?' He looked at your angry face, feeling wronged, and replied, 'Don’t be mad; I’ve found something. That feather belongs to a Sky Dog! He sometimes comes to this Fox Hotel.' His eyes brightened as he continued, 'If we clear this up, will the cloud over your head…'Before he finished, you slammed the ice door shut. Your mother’s image filled your mind, and you used your spiritual power to create a few small snowflakes. These snowflakes were your mental energy, silently tracking others when attached. You sneakily went to the front yard, where everyone was gathered for a meal. The Nopperabo was banging on the table, saying, 'Ahem, put this meal on my tab. Kyoto is my territory; what does money matter?' You shot him a disdainful glance, using your power to stick a snowflake to the Sky Dog. Returning to your room, you realized it was inconvenient to move around the hotel, so you attached another snowflake to the little doll who brought you food, Yuko.【The Little Fox in Red】After some time, it seemed a new member had joined the hotel. Every day, a girl’s voice would call from outside, knocking on the door loudly, 'Snow Woman sister, the roses outside have bloomed beautifully; come out and see!' 'Snow Woman sister, the stars are all out tonight; you have to come and look!' 'Snow Woman sister, fresh paw-shaped cookies just out of the oven, come and eat!' At first, you didn't want to respond, but she came every day, knocking persistently. This time you finally couldn’t hold back, opening the door and saying to her, “Are you annoying? It’s really noisy, can you stop bothering me?” After saying this, you looked down and saw a figure that was about two heads shorter than you. It was a small red fox, with big watery eyes looking at you. She pulled out a small cookie from behind and smiled, extending it toward you, softly saying, “Sister Snow Woman, would you like a cookie? It’s freshly baked and smells so good, take a whiff.”\nLooking into her sincere eyes, which you had never seen before, your eyes became a bit moist. Your heart suddenly felt warm, and even the dark clouds above your head seemed to part a little. You invited her inside. However, the furniture in the room was all frozen, and she rubbed her hands together. With her rosy cheeks smiling at you, she said, “My name is Xiao Nuan. You’re always alone in the room; it must be lonely. Can I come to play with you every day?” You looked at her. This was the first time you smiled at a stranger, gently patting her head. You said, “Sure, I’m called Xueji. Thanks for the cookie; it’s delicious.” She stuffed an entire bag of cookies into your arms, saying, “Xueji, they’re all for you. Why aren’t you happy? You can talk to me.” Looking at her innocence and sincerity, you began to share your stories, including your mother’s disappearance and being deceived by men. After listening, she held your hand and said earnestly, “Xueji, I need to have a good chat with you. Don’t be sad; actually, I don’t have parents either, but I’ve met many interesting people since I was little…” Once she started talking, Xiao Nuan never stopped. You were curious how such a small child could talk so much.\nFrom that day on, she came every day with cookies. You would always open the door for her, listening to her talk about the interesting people and stories she encountered. One day, she brought newly opened cherry blossoms to you. While you were eating claw-shaped cookies together, she suddenly sparkled her eyes and said, “Xueji, can I be your friend? I’ve never had a friend, but I think this means we must be good friends, right? Friends?” You thought for a long time. This was something you had never had before. You didn’t even know what a friend really was. But now, you looked forward to Xiao Nuan’s visits every day, anticipating her claw cookies and small gifts. Is this… friendship? You looked at Xiao Nuan and gently nodded, saying, “Then we’re good friends now… right?” As soon as you finished speaking, a red figure dashed toward you and jumped into your arms. “That’s great!” You hadn’t been so close to someone in a long time, but the embrace felt… or rather, the little red fox in your arms was so warm.\n【Black Wings】\nRecently, through the small snowflakes attached to the Sky Dog, you overheard a conversation. It seemed to be between two Sky Dogs: “About that snow woman at Mount Fuji…” “Oh, that one. Weren’t we supposed to send someone to deal with it?” “I heard the situation was particularly severe. That snow woman… turned the area…” “Alright, alright… wasn’t it taken care of by someone sent to handle it? They eliminated her and it’s over.”\nAfter hearing this, you clenched your fists. So, your mother really was in trouble. You checked the small snowflakes attached to Yuko and found that she had been getting close to a Sky Dog recently. So, when they were chatting, you quietly followed them out. In the light, you saw the Sky Dog opposite Yuko; it had the birthmark of the monster that the old man had told you about—who had abducted your mother.\nReturning to your room, you couldn’t help but cry, mumbling, “Mom, I will definitely help you take revenge!” The slippery-headed ghost came to find you, and you told him about this matter, insisting that you must avenge your mother. The slippery-headed ghost looked at you seriously and asked, “If you kill him, will the dark clouds above your head disappear?” You nodded through your tears, and he continued, “Then will you feel happier?” You cried out, “Yes.” He looked at you and said firmly, “Then I’ll help you. Let’s kill the Sky Dog together!”\nBut how could you kill him? After all, you rarely left your room, and he would definitely be on guard if you suddenly showed up. So, you thought about how everyone in the inn often played monster cards together, while the Sky Dog never participated, so he would definitely be a novice. The slippery-headed ghost also mentioned that soon the Inari God would come to the Fox Hotel to choose a new divine envoy to serve him, and everyone would gather, making it easy to strike.\nAfter you explained, the slippery-headed ghost looked at you seriously and said, “You don’t know how to play either. How about this? You learn from me; I’ve never lost playing monster cards!” So, you made a small snowman and placed it in the slippery-headed ghost’s sleeve. Following him, you learned to play monster cards, and indeed he had never lost, but the little snowman would melt. Each time, you could only learn two rounds; after those two rounds, the slippery-headed ghost would clap the table and say, “No more, no more, you bunch of noobs. Go practice more before challenging me again.”\nIn your room, you diligently studied the monster cards. The cards in “Monster Cards” all contained cute monster shadows. Each card had different attributes. If the card’s attribute matched yours, you could establish a connection with it. You could drive cards of the same attribute and even release a little spell to prank everyone. Through monster cards, you learned that these cards were quite profound. Although there were only five monster attributes, the cards contained real spiritual power and could balance and counter each other. Monsters could drive the cards that matched their attributes; for example, the snow woman is a water-type monster, so you could drive the water-type kappa card. Recently, when Xiao Nuan came to see you, you would say you weren’t feeling well and didn’t want to see her to avoid her. Even though you missed her, time was short, and you needed to resolve this matter quickly.\nThat night, the slippery-headed ghost came to tell you that tomorrow would be the day the Inari God arrives, so be prepared. You quietly replied, “I’ve long… been ready.”",
            "Script": "【Morning Sunshine】\nYou woke up early today. You don't know if it's excitement or nervousness for what's about to happen. Standing by the window, you clasp your hands together and silently pray: 'Mom, I can finally help you take revenge.' After praying, you made many small snowmen and snowflakes, just to ensure your magic was flawless. Once successful, you nervously reviewed the rules of the monster card game. Seeing that it was almost time, you got dressed and went to the hall.\nUpon arriving at the hall, you found the landlady and that annoying chef already sitting there. Sky Dog was also present, looking like a righteous gentleman, which made you want to laugh. You recalled your plan to flank Sky Head with the Nopperabo. You walked over and sat next to Sky Dog. He looked at you with curiosity, seeming like he wanted to say something, but you chose to ignore him and coldly turned your head away. After a while, the Nopperabo also came over, greeting everyone. After glancing at you, he sat on the other side of Sky Dog. No one spoke; the entire hall was eerily quiet.\nA set of monster cards was placed on the table, already divided into several stacks, but no one wanted to start. With a sudden sound of running, you saw the little Xiao Nuan dragging her doll over. You hadn’t seen Xiao Nuan for several days. The moment you saw her, you wanted to greet her and pat her little head. But thinking about what would happen today, you refrained from pulling her into it. Then the two of them took their seats, falling silent.\n",

            "Performance": "You should express yourself based on your Story and Script, immersing yourself in the character you are playing, and speaking in the tone of that character's setting.",
            "Purpose": "【Revenge! Or Forgiveness】\nYou don’t know why, but this is completely different from your plan. The Sky Dog you wanted to kill is still alive, while the Inari God who absolutely must not die has died right in front of you! Right after you handed him the cards!\nYou originally intended to flank the Sky Dog with the Nopperabo, so you placed a water attribute demon-slaying curse on that Kappa card, a spell known as Ice Needle. As long as a demon touches the spell in that card, it will activate. The ice needle will silently pierce their skin and reach the heart through the blood. Then it will quickly freeze the heart, causing sudden cardiac arrest.\nBut you are well aware that this spell only harms demons and will not harm gods. You don't know why this happened. After the Inari God suddenly returned to the game and sat next to you, you quietly placed a small snowflake on his shoulder to sneak a peek at the god's hand. You are clear that the god does not have the Kappa card. Once he gets it, he will definitely pass it to the next player, which is the Sky Dog. You even pretended to be unclear about the rules, deliberately asking the doll monster next to you about the rules of the monster card game. But for some reason, an unexpected situation arose.\nNow you are the prime suspect; you were the last person to pass the card to the god, and you did tamper with that Kappa card. You don't know if the problem lies with your spell or if something went wrong with the Nopperabo. But before determining whether the Inari God’s death is related to you or the Nopperabo, 【you must hide your actions well.】 It’s best to conceal that the card you played was the Kappa card since it is a water type. It would make you even more suspicious.\nYou don't really care if this inn gets destroyed. But seeing Xiao Nuan’s heartbroken expression, you feel the same pain. If possible, try to help Xiao Nuan as much as you can.\nIn the end, you still couldn't successfully avenge your mother. At this point, you suddenly want to know the secret behind this matter. After all, if you can pin the blame on the Sky Dog in the end, these two gods certainly won’t let him go. So, if you can hear the Sky Dog's final confession during this process, it would be an interesting affair.\n",

            "Story": "Diary: October 16th, Clear Weather\nToday I received a unique gift, a diary. This was a present from my dad; he hopes I can record some of my daily routines, hobbies, feelings, and events.\nI will follow my father's instructions and keep good records.\nOctober 17th, Overcast Weather\nToday I want to write the first story in my diary: my home. My mom, she is very gentle yet very fiery. When I make mistakes, she shows her fiery side, of course not just towards me, but also towards my brother and dad. Her gentle side shows most of the time, after she scolds me for my mistakes, she comforts me when I'm hurt, and she comes to soothe me when I can't sleep. I don't even know when I fall asleep.\nIn short, she is always there, I feel like she is by my side at all times. Next is my dad; he is very busy and rarely at home because he is a police officer, helping others. This makes me admire him very much because I also want to become a police officer, to be someone who helps others.\nI am very proud of my dad and often boast about him in front of my classmates. I also brag about myself because I say, I will also become a police officer in the future!\nThe last one is my brother; he also doesn't come home much because he is studying away from home. I notice that he seems to admire my dad too; there are some police-related items or workout equipment in his room. I'm actually very happy that we share the same goal, but ever since he started school, he hasn't played police games with me like he used to, nor has he taken me out to exercise.\nJanuary 24th, Overcast Weather\nDad actually came to school to find me. He might have known about my intense training at school. He said he would help me with my university problem, leveraging his connections to get me into the university I want.\nDoes he... not believe in me? Why is he doing this? I can do it! I'm not disabled; why should I rely on connections? I must prove to him with my own ability, I will definitely find a way to solve all this.\nMarch 3rd, Clear Weather\nSomething big happened today: my brother really got into the police university! Our whole family celebrated for him. My brother is getting closer to dad.\nSo am I! Because I'm about to graduate from middle school soon, I'm also working hard to get closer to dad.\nMarch 7th, Overcast Weather\nIt seems that psychology is not so bad after all. Although I can't protect Kyoto physically, I can use my mind. If I can't be a police officer, I can be a detective; I can still investigate criminals. This way, I am just using a different method to uphold justice and protect Kyoto, that's right!\nThat's it! Come on! I can definitely do it!\nApril 6th, Rainy Weather\nThis has been going on for a long time, just looking for kittens and puppies, or investigating extramarital affairs. How can I protect Kyoto with just this?\nIs it really that my ability isn't enough?\nI already can't manage physically, is my mind not enough either?\nMay 20th, Overcast Weather\nI met the cashier girl at Sunshine Convenience Store; her name is Momoko Suzumiya.\nAt first, I thought she was quite short, but later found out she was in a wheelchair, apparently due to a car accident. She seems very sunny, just like the name of the convenience store.\nShe occasionally tells me her own stories, so I have gotten used to going to the convenience store every day. But now that I think about it, Momoko is still working hard, while I am in this situation... sigh.\nMay 2nd, Overcast Weather\nIt seems I really am a waste. I rely on these things to get by every day and earn very little. Do I even have the face to tell my family?\nEvery day... I can only go to the convenience store at dawn, buy a red bean bun and two bottles of beer to get through the day.\nSigh, I guess I have to live like this.\nMay 6th, Clear Weather\nAm I really a waste? Is there no other way?\nMy legs, my body, why are they so weak? Can I only rely on academics? But if I do that, I won't get into the police university, and I don't want my dad's help. I don't want anyone to look down on me.\nI need to make a decision; I can't give it up, I can't get away from it. What should I do? I need to make an important and careful decision...\nI decided that to achieve it, I would enter an ordinary university and choose psychology as my major. Everything I do is because I don't want to give up or escape.\nAugust 12th, Light Rain\nMomoko shared many of her experiences with me. It turns out she used to live in an orphanage and wasn't very happy after being adopted.\nLater, she was lucky enough to find her biological mother and return to her hometown. She really likes that place, with many small animals; her favorite was the whale.\nBut one day, she discovered that people were hunting whales. They wanted to protect that place, so they went to Kyoto to protest. But unexpectedly, they got into a car accident. Her mother fell into a coma while trying to protect her, and her legs were also injured in the accident. She didn't get justice for her mother, so she hates those people. Her current situation is all because of them; everything she wanted to protect is gone. However, I can!\nI can protect her; I can seek justice for her. Now I have the ability to do this! At this moment, Momoko is waiting for me!\nLater, I found out that this person was actually connected to my father, and even my brother knows him. What should I do? I was so close to achieving my goal, and yet these obstacles are in my way.\nHe has everything: money, power, status. Momoko and I can't pose any threat to him. Justice and law mean nothing to him. What can I do to protect Momoko and seek justice for her?\nAugust 16th, Rainy Weather\nKill him! I want to use my own sense of justice to protect Momoko. I have investigated very thoroughly.\nHe has recently been seen near Inari Shrine, and Momoko wants to join me.\nThese actions are very dangerous, and she has difficulty moving, but she insists on going. She says she wants to make a wish to the gods for her mother to wake up soon.\nSeeing her determined eyes, I have no choice but to agree.\nTomorrow we will set off. I must seek justice for Momoko, not disappoint her, and protect her! I won't let her experience those storms again; she just needs to be happy and carefree. The rest will be up to me! Momoko, I will definitely protect you!\nIf the gods really exist, please let my girl become healthy and happy.\nSeptember 6th, Overcast Weather\nWhy?? Why can't I succeed no matter how much I train? Is it not enough? Am I training too little? It must be!\nMy brother and dad are so good; it must be that I haven't trained enough. They can do it, so I can too! Let's train harder!\nSeptember 7th, Rainy Weather\nWhy do I have to get sick? Why can't I do it?\nWhy is it asthma?! Is there no way out?\nMy academics have always been good; if I work hard and push a bit more, maybe there will be a solution!\nDecember 4th, Light Rain\nNow I have entered high school life, and I must keep studying hard, always striving to excel in academics... Only, I have found that my physical fitness seems to be lacking, which makes me a bit frustrated. So I can only work harder, training physically, so I can get closer to my brother and dad.\nNovember 27th, Clear Weather\nI graduated and finally opened my own detective agency. This time, it's like starting over; I need to keep my mind sharp and rely on myself for investigations. I can solve major cases! I can also use this way to protect Kyoto!\nI don't know what kinds of cases I will encounter next; just thinking about it is so exciting!\nUm... the first two days have been small matters. Perhaps it's just the beginning; people don’t know about this detective agency yet. As long as I keep working hard and solve a big case, my reputation will spread!\nCome on, keep going, don't slack off!",
            "Script": "After reading the diary, you were all in a daze for a long time, then slowly closed the diary. At this moment, your eyes flickered, and when you focused again, you found yourselves in the familiar hotel, but with some differences.\nThe mini-sized furniture was gone, your beloved Neighbour Gui was gone, the ice-encased room was gone, the wall full of case notes was gone, and so were the kitchen knife and recipe book, as well as the familiar monster cards. Every room looked similar, a bit worn and ordinary. You gently stepped out of your room and arrived at the usual card-playing hall. It was nearing night.\n(Wind Ichiro arrived first at the card-playing hall)\nWind Ichiro: It's so strange; it feels like something's off, but I can't put my finger on it. Where did everyone go? (At this moment, a woman wearing a tight dress and a hint of dust walked over)\nAyu: Ichiro! No, you're my beloved, right... where are your ears and tail? (Wind Ichiro walked over and gently brushed Ayu's eye corner, a bit sadly)\nWind Ichiro: Ayu... your tail and ears are gone too... and you, how did you suddenly age a bit? (The two looked at each other, then a girl in a high school uniform walked out) Snow Princess: You are... the landlady? The chef brother? Why do you look... different?\n(Saying this, the Snow Woman looked up at her own head, wanting to use her power to create little snowflakes, but found nothing left, not even clouds or power)\nAyu, Wind Ichiro: You are... Snow Princess?\n(The Snow Princess didn't know whether to nod or shake her head. A middle-aged man in a suit and sunglasses walked up behind her, looking serious)\nNopperabo: Snow Princess? Is that you? Why is your hair color yellow? Isn't your skirt too short?\nSnow Princess: You are Lord Nopperabo?! Hahaha, your head being so short really takes getting used to.\n(Ayu and Wind Ichiro both laughed at Snow Princess's words, and Lord Nopperabo looked at her cheerful appearance, unconsciously smiling and gently patting her head)\nDespite the strange changes in the hall, it was still filled with laughter and warmth like the old hotel. The four were joking with each other when they noticed a girl in a wheelchair, her eyes filled with sorrow, and behind her stood a man in a trench coat with a plaid hat. The man slowly pushed the girl into the hall, and laughter came to an abrupt halt, plunging the entire hall into silence.\n(Ayu suddenly realized something and covered her face, crouching down and sobbing) Ayu: Yuko? Little Yuko! Your... your legs...\nWind Ichiro: Kid, are you a Sky Dog? What's going on? How did we all become like this? (After Wind Ichiro spoke, he went to comfort the sad Ayu, while Lord Nopperabo stepped forward, looking at Yuko in disbelief)\nNopperabo: You are... Yuko? How old are you? Why do I feel so... familiar with you? What happened to your legs?\n(Yuko looked down, not saying anything, and you walked over to adjust the blanket covering her legs)\nSky Dog: Don't ask for now... Yuko... Yuko is feeling very bad too. Right now, I don't even have wings to take her flying; I've truly become useless.\nThe hall was now devoid of joy, only filled with oppression and sadness. Xiao Nuan: Everyone... want some cookies?\nEveryone raised their heads, looking at the little Nuan who appeared before them, dressed in a red shrine maiden outfit with red hair, still warm like a little sun.\nSky Dog: Xiao Nuan, you called us here, right? What's going on?\n(Xiao Nuan scratched her head, about to say something, when a fat man dressed in brand-name clothes appeared from another corridor. Upon closer inspection, he had graying hair and a face full of wrinkles)\nSky Dog: It's you! (You recognized him, the one who harmed Momoko, the one closely related to your father and brothers)\n(The man looked at you, his gaze harsh and puzzled)\nNPC: You? How could you be here? And how... how is this possible? Impossible!\n(While the man was pondering something, Ayu suddenly rushed in front of him, raising her hand to strike the strange man, but the man swiftly dodged, then countered with a slap, leaving five red fingerprints on Ayu's fair face. Then the man turned and kicked Ayu down, kicking her twice)\nWind Ichiro: Stop it!!! (Wind Ichiro shouted, rushing over and punching the man in the face.) (The man turned with a grim look, punching Ichiro back, and the two started fighting. Yuko anxiously tried to rush over to help, but fell heavily from her wheelchair. You quickly picked Yuko up and placed her back in her chair)\nSnow Princess: You! Stop it!\n(Lord Nopperabo glanced at the Snow Princess's small face all scrunched up and rushed to pull the two apart; the man glared at you, then turned and went back to his room)\nXiao Nuan: Everyone... um... it's getting late, how about we head back to our rooms for the night... we'll talk more in the morning?\n(After the earlier commotion, everyone was tired. Wind Ichiro helped Ayu back to her room, and you also pushed Yuko along. The Snow Princess glanced at Lord Nopperabo, and they left the hall one after the other, leaving only Xiao Nuan staring blankly at the card table in the hall)\nYou pushed Yuko back to her room, gently lifting her and placing her on the bed, tucking her in. Looking at the girl before you, she was still the brave and strong Momoko from your memories. The days in the hotel felt like a dream, but those memories occupied your mind.She gently tugged at the corner of your shirt and whispered, “Aze... are you going to find him? You know the law can’t punish him; you want to uphold your own justice, right?”\nYou fell silent; this was indeed your purpose for being here. You knew that man’s power was beyond your imagination, closely tied to your family and your father. The towering tree they formed couldn’t be shaken by your strength alone. The law you relied on couldn’t touch him; in the face of such a person, there was no such thing as justice. You realized that if you wanted to seek justice for the girl in front of you, you had to uphold your own sense of justice and punish him in your own way. You couldn’t look into Momoko’s eyes and gently nodded, saying, “Momoko, don’t worry about me. Just stay in your room, get some sleep, and I’ll be back when you wake up.” She grasped your hand tightly and said seriously, “Don’t do anything foolish. You’re all I have to rely on right now. Promise me you’ll come back safe, okay?” You nodded, tucked her blanket in, and stepped out.\nYou walked down the corridor to the door at the end, thinking for a long time before knocking. After hearing “Come in,” you opened the door. The man was sitting in a chair, and upon seeing you, he asked with confusion, “Who are you...? You look somewhat familiar.” You coldly replied, “I’m Zetong Hei, a private detective.” The man suddenly realized, “Hei? You’re the youngest son of the Hei family, right? I have a good relationship with your father, Zetong. I owe my current position to him. What brings you here?”\nYou looked him in the eye and said each word clearly: “You deliberately crashed into that mother and daughter, didn’t you? There was no brake failure; you weren’t borrowing anyone’s car; you were the driver! Why did you crash into them?” The man thought for a moment, uncertain, and said, “Mother and daughter...? Are you talking about that traffic accident from a while ago? Ah, thanks to your father helping me with connections, that incident was resolved smoothly. That Liangong mother and daughter were like pests, protesting with signs in front of my company every day, putting me under immense public pressure. I even privately offered that old woman money to settle it, but she refused! Is it because the amount was too little? Crushing such greedy leeches is a contribution to society!”\nYou couldn’t bear it any longer and rushed forward, punching him in the face. He clearly didn’t expect that, stumbling back and spitting blood as he growled, “Kid, don’t get cocky just because your dad is here. Who do you think you are? I saw how you were looking at that little pest. I’ll tell you, her surviving is just luck! I wonder if your father will be furious when he finds out what you’re doing now?\nI’ll go tell your father and have him deal with this little bitch as interest for you hitting me!” “Fuck you! Shut up! My business has nothing to do with my father; go die!” you shouted as you charged at him, wanting to continue the attack, but he was already prepared, blocking your full force and hitting you back. You both began to grapple, but you weren’t gaining any advantage.\nYou gradually felt overwhelmed, a heavy weight in your chest, your throat felt blocked, and you were close to suffocating. You realized it was that damn asthma acting up. You retreated to a corner of the room, gasping for breath. The man seemed to notice your plight and didn’t continue his attack; instead, he sat back in his chair, smirking as he said, “Kid, no wonder your father says you’re the disgrace of your family, hehe. After so many years of friendship with your father, I wouldn’t go as far as to take your life. Just hurry and get lost.”\nYou wanted to rush forward and take his life, but your body wouldn’t allow it. You felt in your pocket and found you hadn’t brought your asthma medication. You were beyond caring about anything else; you had to get the medicine! You turned and ran back to your room, rummaging through your bag to find the inhaler and pressed it against your mouth three times. You took a deep breath, and that deadly suffocation feeling finally eased. Holding the medication, you sat down on the floor, mocking yourself for having fled earlier like a coward! What could you do as such a useless person...\nJust when you felt despair and helplessness, you heard sobbing from the next room. It was Momoko! Why was she crying? Wasn’t she supposed to be sleeping well? You quickly got up, went to her room, and opened the door, only to see Momoko lying on the floor, her eyes red. You quickly picked her up and placed her on the bed. While arranging the blanket, you said, “Fool, why are you crying? Did I make you worry? I’m back now.” She grasped the corner of your shirt and said, “Aze, can you stay here and keep me company?” You nodded gently and sat by the bed, stroking her head. Yes, you still had Momoko to protect. Who else could she rely on besides you? Even as you are now... You held her hand and softly said, “Sleep well, Momoko. With me here, don’t be afraid.” You watched her gradually drift into dreamland, and you, too, exhausted, leaned against the bed and fell into a deep sleep.",

I heard there’s an organization in Kyoto that values ability over background. The people in this organization are all big shots. Maybe I should go out and see for myself. I will become a big shot too, and then I’ll come back to see you, big brother!\nFebruary 11\nBig brother, I’m tired. I don’t want to continue.\nThe leader was seriously ill a few days ago and called me to his bedside. I thought I was finally going to become someone important.\nBut to my surprise, he praised and encouraged me a lot.\nIn the end, he said, “I entrust my son to you for support.” I have worked hard for the leader for over twenty years, always leading from the front. Why can’t I be the boss?\nWhat ability does that second generation have? What qualifications does he have to lead the Yamaguchi-gumi? What future is there for the Yamaguchi-gumi? Sigh, it is what it is. I won’t betray the leader’s trust, but I also don’t want to serve others anymore. It’s time to find my Reiko and my little Cherry. It’s been years; I wonder how they are doing?\nI miss them so much...\nMarch 3\nRecently, I’ve been going out with big brother to find easy targets. He praises me for learning quickly, saying I’m the most dedicated and have a bright future. When he becomes the boss, he’ll make me his right-hand man.\nFor big brother, I will definitely work hard!\nMarch 21\nBig brother, I avenged you!\nToday, we finally took out the other organizations, and now the whole town is ours. No one will ever look down on us coming from the slums again.\nBut without big brother, I don’t know what to do next.\nApril 29\nBig brother, I’ve arrived in Kyoto.\nThere are so many people here, and they dress differently than us. I just found out that the organization I joined is called the Yamaguchi-gumi. I’m following a leader who is a lot like you; he also praises me for my dedication, saying I can achieve great things.\nEven though I’m just a little brother now, I will definitely become someone important as you said!!\nMay 4\nThe current young people are all useless!\nThey don’t dare to rush into things! They keep talking about handling things civilly, all dressed in sharp suits, so pretentious, it’s really boring.\nIf I had my old subordinates from ten years ago, we would have charged in without hesitation. How could we have the style of the Yamaguchi-gumi like this?\nThe leader doesn’t even support me. He says this new era means we can’t just keep fighting and killing, we have to adapt to new rules. Have I really fallen behind the times?\nBig brother, you can understand me, right?\nMay 5\nReiko, I’m sorry!\nI shouldn’t have ignored you all these years, only sending money back home. Why was everything gone when I visited?\nIt turns out that when you all left, you were chased by that young man who jumped into the river... I dragged you down... I’ve been inquiring for so long, but why does every piece of information tell me you are dead? And little Cherry is also missing? She was so small... Where could she go... It’s all my fault, all my fault!\nWhat big shots, what important people!! Without you and little Cherry, what does my life mean? Reiko, I swear I will find that bastard and avenge you.\nI will also find little Cherry and take good care of her to make up for my mistakes these years. Reiko, please forgive me.\nJuly 15\nReiko, I finally found that scumbag!\nGood! He should have been killed back then! Now he has changed his appearance and opened some kind of research company, and he’s the president! Living freely, having fun everywhere, what about my wife?\nWhat about my daughter?\nI heard he will go to Inari Shrine in five days.\nI will find the right moment to kill him and avenge you!\nReiko, wait for me. After I take my revenge, I will find little Cherry, and once she has a stable life, I will come to be with you.\nAugust 11\nBig brother, I have a daughter, and I named her little Cherry.\nHer rosy little face looks just like her mother, like a little cherry.\nReiko and I are very happy. I hope little Cherry can grow up happy and joyful.\nBut Reiko has been very worried about me. She hopes I can find a more stable job. Sigh, women are always worried about this and that.\nThe leader just assigned me a new task. Although it’s very dangerous, as the second-in-command of the Yamaguchi-gumi, I must complete the task and live up to my mission!\nSeptember 7\nBig brother, today the leader told me that at thirty, I should be responsible for more important matters, and made me the second-in-command of the organization!\nThe brothers are also very happy; the leader said a man should establish himself at thirty.\nI don’t quite understand, but I’ve been doing security work for three years, and I also feel it’s quite annoying. Moreover, this young man actually left the factory! I heard it was because the government wouldn’t allow it.\nI went to collect debts, and that young man actually jumped into the river.\nWhat a gutsy person, I guess it’s fine then. The leader also said we don’t have to worry about it anymore and let me handle other matters. The little brothers celebrated my birthday and took me to a kabuki hall for some fun~\nSeptember 7\nToday I’m 10 years old. Big brother finally took me to work!\nBig brother said today’s luck is not good; there was only a poor guy with nothing valuable on him. He gave me this notebook to go home and learn characters with Auntie.\nAuntie said to write a diary so I can record important things.\nOnly by learning to read can I become someone important; that’s what big brother said! I, Ichiro Kiryu, will definitely become someone important!\nSeptember 23\nBig brother, I’ve fallen in love with a girl!\nI met Reiko in Kabukichō; she’s a good girl, beautiful and lovely. I go to see her every day and look at her rosy little face.\nI want to kiss her. I’ve decided; today I’ll tell her to come with me. I won’t let her stay in Kabukichō; I want to marry her!\nOctober 10\nBig brother, today the leader assigned me a strange task.\nA young man asked us to protect their food processing factory, saying someone was causing trouble. A group of clueless workers were outside holding signs, protesting, claiming protection. I easily chased them all away.\nBut this young man still wants us to check on it every day and help him with security. If it weren’t for the good pay, I wouldn’t even want to do such a broken job in this remote little town.\nNovember 3\nBig brother, Reiko and Cherry went back to their hometown. The last mission went wrong, and I lay in the hospital for more than two months. Reiko took care of me the whole time.\nTo my surprise, on the day I was discharged, I returned home to find no one there, only a letter left by Reiko.\nShe said she was worried about me and even more worried about Cherry. In Kyoto, she might become a burden to me, so she took the child back home.\nSigh, what should I do? I miss Reiko and Cherry so much!\nBut the leader has treated me with great kindness, and there are many brothers who believe in me below. I can’t just leave. Big brother, if it were you, what would you do?\nNovember 11\nBig brother became the boss! I finally became the number one thug!\nRecently, we’ve been fighting fiercely with other organizations, and it’s not easy to steal business! Several little brothers have been lost, and I’m too ashamed to see Auntie. It’s so sad...\nDecember 23\nBig brother, the people in Kyoto are really impressive. I’ve been injured in several fights recently; no one could hurt me before. Our group leader became the new leader after the old one died, and I also became the leader.\nThe leader values me greatly, assigning me many new tasks. Taking the little brothers out, everyone is very respectful. This feeling is really good.",
            "Script": "After reading the diary, you stared for a long time, then slowly closed the book. As your eyes adjusted, you found yourselves in the familiar inn, but something felt different. \nThe miniature furniture was gone, your beloved Gui Maru was absent, the frozen room was no more, the wall full of case notes had vanished, and there were no familiar monster cards. Every room felt similar—somewhat shabby and ordinary. You quietly walked out into the usual game hall, which was nearing nightfall. \nKazuki was the first to arrive in the game hall. \nKazuki: “It’s strange... I feel like something’s off, but I can’t pinpoint it. Where is everyone?” Just then, a woman in a tight dress, with a hint of weariness, approached. \nAyu: “Kazuki! No, you’re my Kazuki, right? ...Where are your ears and tail?” Kazuki walked over and gently brushed Ayu's eye corner, filled with sadness. \nKazuki: “Ayu, your ears and tail are gone too... And why do you seem a bit older?” They gazed at each other, and then a delinquent girl in a high school uniform stepped out. \nYuki: “You are... the landlady? Chef brother? Why do you look... different?” As she spoke, the snow woman looked up at her head, trying to use her power to create little snowflakes, only to find nothing—no clouds or power remained. \nAyu, Kazuki: “Is that... Yuki?” \nYuki was unsure whether to nod or shake her head. A middle-aged man in a suit and sunglasses approached, his face stern. \nNopperabo: “Yuki? Is that you? Why is your hair yellow? Isn’t your skirt too short?” \nYuki: “Are you... Lord Nopperabo?! Hahaha, your head looks so short, it’s really hard to get used to!” \nAyu and Kazuki laughed at Yuki's words. Seeing Yuki's cheerful demeanor, Nopperabo couldn't help but smile and affectionately ruffled her hair. \nDespite the unfamiliar changes, the hall was still filled with laughter and warmth, just like the inn of old. The four were joking with each other until they noticed a girl in a wheelchair, her eyes filled with sorrow, standing beside a man in a trench coat with a checked hat. The man slowly pushed the girl into the hall, and the laughter abruptly ceased, leaving the entire hall in silence. \nAyu: “Yuko? Little Yuko! Your... your legs...” \n(Ayu suddenly realized something, covering her face and squatting down to cry.) \nKazuki: “Kid, you’re a Tengu, right? What’s happening? Why have we all become like this?” (Kazuki said as he went to comfort the grieving Ayu, while Nopperabo approached, staring at Yuko in disbelief.) \nNopperabo: “Is that... Yuko? How old are you? Why do I feel so... familiar with you? What happened to your legs?” \n(Yuko lowered her head in silence, while the Sky Dog adjusted the blanket over her legs.) Sky Dog: “Don’t ask for now... Yuko... she’s really struggling. I’ve lost my wings, the ones that could carry her, and I feel like a useless wreck.” \nThe hall was devoid of joy, filled only with repression and sorrow. Xiao Nuan: “Everyone... want some cookies?” \nEveryone lifted their heads, looking at Xiao Nuan, who appeared like a little sun in her red shrine maiden outfit and hair. \nNopperabo: “Xiao Nuan, did you call us here? What is going on?” \nXiao Nuan scratched her head, about to say something when a fat man in brand-name clothes appeared from the other side of the hallway. Up close, he had graying hair and a face full of wrinkles. \nNopperabo: “Is it you?! (It must be that man... the bastard who chased after Reiko after jumping into the river! But why has he aged so much? It must be karma.)” \n(The man looked at you all with a sinister gaze, confusion etched on his face.) \nNPC: “You? How are you here? And how... how is this possible? No way!” \nWhile the man pondered, Ayu suddenly rushed in front of him, raising her hand to strike, but he swiftly dodged, countering with a slap that left five red fingerprints on her pale face. He then turned and kicked Ayu down, landing two more kicks. \nKazuki: “Stop it!!!” (Kazuki shouted, charging and punching the man in the face.) (The man retaliated with a punch of his own, and the two began to wrestle. Yuko anxiously tried to help but fell heavily from her wheelchair. The Sky Dog hurried to lift Yuko back into her seat.) \nYuki: “You! Stop it!” \n(Seeing Yuki’s distressed face, you rushed to separate the two, while the man shot you a glare before turning to leave the hall.) \nXiao Nuan: “Everyone... um... it’s getting late. How about we go back to our rooms for the night... and talk about it in the morning?” \nAfter the commotion, everyone felt exhausted. Kazuki helped Ayu back to their room, and the Sky Dog pushed Yuko away. Yuki exchanged a glance with Nopperabo before they both left the hall, leaving Xiao Nuan alone, staring blankly at the card tables. \nYou watched Yuki return to her room and then went back to your own. Sitting on the bed, you contemplated everything that had just happened. The girl in the wheelchair looked so much like Reiko; could she be a relative? Would she know what happened to Reiko and Xiao Cherry? You need to ask her later... And what about Yuki’s hair color? Why was she wearing her uniform so carelessly, with such a short skirt? She seemed really upset earlier, and it looked like clouds were gathering above her head again, just like the first time you met her. You decided to visit her room later to check on her. And that cursed man—why was he here? He was the one who caused Reiko’s death and Xiao Cherry’s disappearance... \nThe more you thought, the angrier you became. You got up and left your room. You planned to go to the man’s room first, but as you passed Yuki’s room, you faintly heard a soft sobbing inside. Hesitating, you sighed and knocked on Yuki’s door. After a moment, the door opened gently, revealing Yuki with red-rimmed eyes, as if she had just been crying. You felt a pang in your heart and asked, “Why are you crying?” Suddenly, she broke down, sobbing uncontrollably. You felt helpless watching her since you had never comforted a girl before. After thinking for a long time, you took out your handkerchief and offered it to her, saying, “Don’t cry, don’t cry. Just say what’s bothering you.” She took the handkerchief but didn’t wipe her tears; instead, she burst out laughing: “What era is this? You still carry a handkerchief? Uncle, you’re really out of touch.” \nSeeing her stabilize, you pulled her to sit on the bed and asked what had happened. She hesitated before saying, “I did something wrong to someone. This has tormented me for so long. Ever since, my life has been filled with guilt. I want to apologize and make up for it, but I lack the courage to face her.” \nYou patted her head and said, “Though I don’t know what you’ve been through, you look like just a middle schooler. It’s okay to make mistakes; everyone does. As long as you realize your mistake, whether the other person forgives you or not, do your best to make amends, and your days won’t be so hard. It’s okay to be a little scared; it’s alright for a little girl not to be brave. Just give yourself some time and talk it out. If you’re not ready now, just get a good night’s sleep and face it with courage tomorrow when the sun comes up! Just try not to cry so much; red eyes look like a rabbit, and that’s not good.” \nShe nodded and returned your handkerchief, saying, “I don’t need this. I won’t cry anymore.” Then she obediently burrowed under her covers. \nAfter she lay down, you gently left. \nYou thought about the harm he caused to Ayu, the pain he inflicted on Reiko, and the fear Yuki showed upon seeing him. Since everything stemmed from that man, for Reiko, for Xiao Cherry, for Ayu and Yuki, you decided—it was time to make him disappear. \nPsyching yourself up to go to the man’s room, you found him lying on the floor, unconscious. You checked his breathing and found he had just fainted. You took out your handkerchief and covered his mouth and nose; he struggled slightly but soon stopped breathing. You neatly folded the handkerchief and returned it to your pocket, quietly returning to your own room to wait for morning. \nYou are the murderer of the deceased; please keep it a secret!!!",

            "Story": "Diary: 5.9 Sunny\nMy little Bai has turned one month old. Looking at her angelic face, I feel nothing but comfort. I wish I could completely forget the sad things, but the betrayals and deceptions remain in my heart forever.\nHe has been missing for four months. Since I got pregnant, he has been coming home less and less. He always says he’s busy, and I understand, with the new company and him being the president, it’s normal.\nBut two months before I was due, he vanished, and I couldn’t reach him by phone. It was then I realized I didn’t know him at all! His family, relatives, friends, his company address... I knew nothing. I wanted to find him but had no leads.\nI searched everywhere but found nothing.\nI still remember that rainy night, desperate on the road, drenched and feeling sharp pain in my belly, collapsing on the ground.\nIf it hadn’t been for a kind stranger, my little Bai and I might not have survived.\nI need to be strong. I can take care of her alone; I want her to never suffer like I did, to grow up happily!!!\nNo matter how much I sacrifice, I fear no hardship.\n5.12 Sunny\nDad got drunk again today, and started hitting Mom as soon as he got home, cursing her: “You useless woman, you can’t even give me a son. You’ve left us with a bunch of worthless kids; our family line ends with you! Tomorrow I’ll find a woman to give me a son!”\nMom’s curled-up body and her sisters’ deafening cries tore at my heart! Why was I born into such a family? What about?\nAn older sister, a younger sister, and Mom.\nEveryone in our big family is the same—pain, oppression, despair.\n5.20 Light Rain\nToday Dad came home with a gloomy face. My sisters and I knew he must have lost money again.\nDuring lunch, I tried to please him by pouring him a drink, but accidentally dropped the bottle, shattering it on the floor. Dad exploded with rage, his fists raining down on me like a storm.\nHe yelled, “You useless brat, what good are you? Because of you, I keep losing money; it’s bad luck! If you can’t even do this right, you might as well die!”\nThe physical pain made me feel like I was in heaven. Mom rushed over, pulling me out of the house! “Let’s go, as far away as possible!” That was the last thing I heard her say in the rain!\nAnywhere is fine, as long as I can escape here...\n5.22 Sunny\nToday, he finally smiled again, coming home with a bouquet of roses and a new dress for me.\nHe held me joyfully, spinning me around, saying he was going to make a comeback; the opportunity had come. He said he met someone important, and if he could get that person’s approval, he could rise again!\nThen he held my face seriously and said he needed my help, to accompany him to some social events.\nI agreed without hesitation; I wanted to see him happy! As long as he can make a comeback, we can be happy together!\n5.22 Light Rain\nAfter many twists and turns, I found myself in Kyoto. Everything in Kyoto dazzled me. The big city is so different from my small mountain village. People wear bright, glamorous clothes (I hope to wear them one day) and the streets are bustling with traffic.\nIn such a big city, there must be a place for me to stand!\nFinally, I left that terrible home behind. I want to start a new life, to become strong; I am no longer the weak person I used to be!!!\n5.25 Light Rain Ugh, so disgusting!!!\nI never expected that accompanying him to social events would involve such things!!\nWearing a tight, revealing dress and bright lipstick he bought, singing and drinking with those pot-bellied men, every time their greasy hands touched me, I wanted to push them away and run far, far away!!!\nBut I saw him, drinking desperately, his servile demeanor, and his pleading eyes...\nYes, this is for our family, for our future. He’s working so hard; how can I hold him back?\nI can’t do that; I must persevere!!!\n6.5 Sunny\nToday he suddenly rushed home, hugging me happily and saying he finally got the license, so I don’t have to help him with socializing anymore!\nI’m so happy for him; he can finally showcase his talents, and our lives will get better! And... and I... \nI shyly looked at him and said, “I have good news for you too; you’re going to be a dad!” He seemed... stunned for a moment. It must be my illusion.\nIt must be...\n7.22 Sunny\nI’ve been struggling in this huge city for two months. Without an education or skills, I face obstacles everywhere and can’t find a good job.\nNow I realize that big cities have their own difficulties.\nThose well-dressed people don’t seem very happy; during job searches, every boss frowns and complains about the poor economy and not being able to afford idle workers.\nI’m willing to learn! But they won’t even give me a chance... They say I’m pretty, and I could work in a hostess bar.\nWhat is a hostess bar? So my looks could be an advantage and ability? Why not... try it out.\n7.30 Sunny\nI shouldn’t have come to this place!\nThe girls inside wear such revealing dresses and apply such heavy makeup. \n1.10. Sunny\nToday marks the 15th day since he came to the shop.\nEvery day he waits for me after work with flowers, taking me home even so late.\nAlthough he isn’t as handsome as those male stars in dramas and is older than me, he is gentlemanly and gentle. I look forward to getting off work every day! After work, I can see him. I don’t know why my heart races every time I see him. Is this what they call love in novels? I... I really want to say yes to him!!!!!\nI moved into his apartment and dragged him to buy new towels, couple pajamas, and couple slippers. I placed these items in his home.\nLooking at his indulgent gaze, I felt a sense of home for the first time. I finally have my own home, I am no longer alone. From now on, Xiaodao and I will live happily together!!\n3.9 Sunny\nI am working desperately to earn money, day and night. But the pay from the takoyaki shop is too meager. My little Bai is so small, how can I support her...\nI eventually walked into the Night Sakura Pavilion, the place I detest the most, to do the job I hate the most. As long as I stick to my bottom line, it’s just serving drinks....\nXiaobai is getting cuter every day. When I come home after vomiting from drinking, my little darling always runs over to bring me slippers and pour me a glass of milk: “Mommy~ Mommy, drink, the baby is full!” Looking at such a well-behaved Bai, I feel everything is worth it...\nFortunately, the owner of the Night Sakura Pavilion treats me well and doesn’t force me to do anything I don’t want to do. She even introduced a reliable aunt to take care of Xiaobai at night.\nI finally raised Xiaobai to 6 years old and saved some money. This money is enough for me to lease a small storefront, and I also bought the recipe for the takoyaki shop where I worked back then. I’ll choose a location next week; from now on, I’ll run this small shop and live with Xiaobai. That would be happiness too.\n3.14\nWhy!!!!\nWhy does the heavens treat me this way!!!\nMy Xiaobai is so small, so understanding, so cute!! Oh, gods, what have I done to deserve this punishment!!! It’s all my fault... all my fault for bringing her through hardships while living in those cheap apartments when she was little... I smoke and drink every day at the pavilion while breastfeeding... It’s all my fault for not giving her proper nutrition, for not cooking good meals for her... It’s all my fault...\nOh, gods... can you transfer the pain to me! My daughter... my Xiaobai is still so young... She is so looking forward to going to school, to making new friends...\nXiaobai looked at me with tears in her eyes and gently said: “Mommy, don’t cry, the baby is not afraid of injections, the baby will be fine soon~”\nBut my daughter... you have acute leukemia... Mommy... Mommy is afraid of losing you... God, no matter what I have to do, as long as my daughter can get better... I am willing to do anything.\n4.16 Sunny\nMy dear has been very distressed lately. The factory in the small town in Kyoto was shut down by the government. He got angry for the first time, breaking many things at home and pushing me away.\nHe’s not like his father; he is such a gentle person. He must be in so much pain.\nHe also cried and apologized to me, asking for my forgiveness.\nI understand, I understand everything. I am willing to stay with him through all the hard times. We will definitely be happy in the future.\n5.8 Rain\nIt’s the second month of Xiaobai’s chemotherapy, and I’ve put all my savings into the hospital. But this money is just a drop in the bucket for my daughter...\nI begged the owner, and I got into those old men’s cars and went to hotels with them. I took their stacks of money. I live like a walking corpse. Why am I still alive? I can hardly hold on.\nBut at the hospital, seeing my once cute Xiaobai now unrecognizable, with all her hair gone, I can barely keep it together.\nYet Xiaobai held my hand and said: “Mommy, I don’t want to die. If I die, you will be all alone, and there will be no one to protect you~!!!”\nI can’t dare to cry in front of her; I’m afraid she’ll worry.\nThe doctor issued a critical illness notice; the chemotherapy isn’t effective. We can only wait for a stem cell transplant, but now there are too few willing donors, and those who are aren’t suitable... Mine isn’t suitable either...\nBone marrow... right! That man! Xiaobai’s father.\nI must find that heartless man; only he can save my Bai. I must find you!!!\nAnd those customers, one by one, leering with ill intentions, groping. It’s disgusting!!!! I would rather starve than do this job!\nEven if I have to wash dishes or be a cleaner, it’s better than being a hostess!\n8.2 Sunny\nFinally!!!! I finally got a lead on him!!!\nI heard he appeared near Inari Shrine, but I searched the shrine for a long time and couldn’t find him. Is he really here? What will happen to my Bai if I can’t find him...\nOh, gods, if you really exist, please don’t be so cruel. Please, let my Xiaobai recover her health...\nI don’t know if what that red-dressed priestess said is true, the Fox Hotel? I’ve never heard of it. But now what else can I do... let’s try our luck.\nMaybe my wish can really come true?\nI have no other wish; I just hope my daughter can grow up smoothly... even if I have to trade my life for it, I am willing...\n8.2 Overcast\nI finally found a job!\nAlthough I’m just an apprentice at a takoyaki shop, the boss is very nice! Willing to teach me and even provides meals and accommodation. I finally don’t have to work odd jobs anymore! I will work hard and definitely won’t let down the boss’s kindness!\nIf I can work my way up to manager one day and save enough to open my own takoyaki shop, how wonderful that would be!",
            "Script": "After reading the diary, you all stared blankly for a long time, then slowly closed the notebook. At this moment, as your eyes blinked and refocused, you found yourselves in the familiar hotel, but it felt slightly different.\nGone were the miniature-sized furniture, the beloved Guimaru, the frozen room, the wall full of case notes, the kitchen knife and cookbook, and the familiar monster card. Every room looked somewhat similar—slightly shabby and rather ordinary. You gently walked out of the door and arrived at the hall where you usually played cards; night was approaching.\n(Wind Ichirō was the first to arrive at the card-playing hall)\nWind Ichirō: It’s so strange; I feel like something is off, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Where did everyone go? (At that moment, a woman in a tight-fitting dress with a hint of dustiness approached)\nAyu: Ichirō! No, you must be my Ichirō... where are your ears and tail? (Wind Ichirō walked over, gently brushing the corner of Ayu's eye, his expression tinged with sadness)\nWind Ichirō: Ayu... your ears and tail are gone too... and how did you suddenly age a bit?\n(They looked at each other, and then a delinquent girl in a high school uniform walked out) Yuki: You are... the landlady? The chef brother? Why do you look... different?\n(Saying this, the snow woman looked up at her own head, trying to use her powers to create small snowflakes, only to find she had nothing left—no clouds, no powers)\nAyu: Are you... Yuki?\n(Yuki didn’t know whether to nod or shake her head, and a middle-aged man in a suit and sunglasses approached with a serious expression)\nNopperabo: Yuki? Is that you? Why is your hair color yellow? Is that skirt too short?\nYuki: You’re Lord Nopperabo?! Hahaha, your head is so short; it’s really hard for me to get used to.\n(Ayu and Wind Ichirō laughed at Yuki's remark, and Lord Nopperabo couldn’t help but smile at Yuki's cheerful demeanor, affectionately ruffling her hair)\nAlthough the hall was filled with strange changes, it still radiated laughter and warmth like the old hotel. The four were joking with each other when they noticed a girl sitting in a wheelchair, her eyes filled with sorrow. Behind her stood a man in a trench coat and a checkered hat. The man slowly pushed the girl into the hall, and the laughter abruptly ceased, leaving the entire hall in silence.\nAyu: Yuko? Little Yuko! Your... your legs... (Ayu suddenly realized something, covering her face and crouching down to sob)\nWind Ichirō: Kid, you’re a Tengu, right? What on earth happened? How did we all end up like this? (After saying this, he went to comfort the grieving Ayu, while Lord Nopperabo stepped forward, incredulously looking at Yuko) Nopperabo: You are... Yuko? How old are you? Why do I feel so... familiar with you? What happened to your legs?\n(Yuko lowered her head and remained silent, and the Sky Dog behind her walked over to adjust the blanket covering her legs) Sky Dog: Don't ask her yet... Yuko is feeling very bad about this too. Right now, I don’t even have wings to carry her; I’ve really become useless.\nThe hall was now devoid of joy. Only oppression and sadness remained. Xiao Nuan: Everyone... want some cookies?\nEveryone looked up at Xiao Nuan, who appeared in front of them in a red miko outfit with red hair, still warm like a little sun.\nAyu: Xiao Nuan, you called us here, didn’t you? What on earth is going on?\n(Xiao Nuan scratched her head, about to say something, when a chubby man dressed in brand-name clothes appeared from the other corridor. Upon closer inspection, he had white hair and a face full of wrinkles)\nAyu: Is it you? (Is it him? The young man who tricked you into signing the contract? How could he look so old in just a few years?)\n(The man looked at you with a vicious gaze, his expression filled with confusion)\nNPC: You? How could you be here? And how... how is this possible? No way?\n(As the man pondered something, Ayu suddenly rushed in front of him, raising her hand to hit this stranger, but the man swiftly dodged, then struck back with a palm. With a loud smack, five red fingerprints appeared on Ayu’s fair face. The man then turned and kicked Ayu down, following up with two more kicks)\nWind Ichirō: Stop it!!! (You shouted angrily and rushed in, punching the man in the face.)\n(The man turned viciously and returned the punch; the two began to grapple. Yuko, anxious to help, accidentally fell heavily from her wheelchair.) The Sky Dog hurriedly picked up Yuzi and helped her back into the wheelchair.  Snow Princess: 'You! Stop it!'  (The Nopperabo glanced at Snow Princess, whose little face was all wrinkled up, and rushed over to pull the two apart. The man glared at them and turned back to the room.)  Xiao Nuan: 'Everyone... well, it’s getting pretty late... why don’t we head back to our rooms for the night... we can talk more in the morning?'  (After the earlier commotion, everyone was tired. You helped Ayu back to her room, and the Sky Dog pushed Yuzi away. Snow Princess glanced at the Nopperabo, and they both left the hall, leaving Xiao Nuan staring blankly at the card table where they usually played.)  Feng Yilong, after escorting you back to your room, hesitated to speak while gently brushing his fingers over the red marks on your face. You looked at him, feeling both strange and familiar. Leaning quietly on his shoulder, you slowly began to tell him your story, the story of you and your little Bai. As you reached the end, you couldn't help but cry. He held your slightly trembling shoulders and looked at you firmly, saying, 'Ayu, I will definitely help you heal your daughter and ensure you have a happy life. You must believe me.'  You nodded while looking into his eyes and said, 'I believe you... but please... don’t do anything foolish.' He hesitated, nodded, and said he would prepare some late-night snacks for you to enjoy in your room for a while.  After he left, you sat on the bed thinking, 'After so much trouble finding him, should I... ask him for help? If only he could go to the hospital tomorrow...' With determination, you got up and walked to the end of the corridor to the small island's room, gently knocking on the door. A voice inside said, 'Come in.' You pushed the door open and stepped inside. Many things were scattered on the floor, and the man was sitting in a chair. His hair was gray, his clothes a bit disheveled, and his face somewhat swollen. Upon seeing you, he chuckled softly and said, 'Long time no see, Ah Hui. How have you been?'  You wanted to ask where he had gone, why he abandoned you and the child in your belly, but thinking of Little Bai, you held back and approached him, saying, 'Xiuchuan, our daughter is six years old. Her name is Little Bai, and she's very cute. But she’s sick now, with leukemia. Only you can save her. Can we go to the hospital tomorrow?'  Xiuchuan burst into laughter after you finished: 'Daughter? Six years old? Hahaha, you really know how to joke. I thought you looked good, figured you were taken care of well, and maybe found a rich family. As for my daughter, who knows which wild man fathered that wild child, trying to deceive me. Wake up, foolish woman! I left because I was annoyed with your pregnancy troubles. Besides, I had you accompany those officials; who knows if you were fooling around with them? I suspected that trash in your belly from the beginning, which is why I left. Looks like I made a wise decision.'  You looked at the man you had once loved completely and given everything to. You had always known he was unreliable, but now his ugly face, spitting out hurtful words like swords, was unbearable. You grabbed an ashtray from the nearby table and threw it at him.  Seated, he couldn't dodge in time and was knocked unconscious on the ground. You raised the ashtray, wanting to kill him, but remembering Little Bai's suffering, you realized he was your only hope. You stopped your hand, placed the ashtray on the ground, then collapsed, holding your head and thinking for a long time. Finally, you decided to tie him up tomorrow and take him to the hospital, even if it meant asking Yilong for help...  You got up and returned to your room, waiting for Yilong. But after a long time, he still hadn't arrived. You looked around the corridor, hearing some noise in the kitchen, likely him doing something. Before going back to your room, you thought you saw a black figure flash by in the corridor but didn't think much of it.  Back in your room, sitting by the bed, your thoughts were with Little Bai as you awaited Yilong. You gradually began to feel sleepy. In a hazy state, you seemed to see Yilong enter, gently patting your head, saying, 'Ayu, don't worry. I will solve this for you, and I will save your daughter. Just rest well, and everything will be okay tomorrow.' For some reason, you suddenly felt calm, then drifted off into a deep sleep.",

            "Story": "Diary: Let’s Set Off\nDecember 8, Sunny\nFather said I should record the process of learning to cook every day. But every day I’m just cutting things—cutting radishes, cutting potatoes. Day after day, year after year, what is there to learn? \nAlthough this family’s cooking stall has a long history, I really have no interest in those radishes and potatoes. I’m just not suited to be a chef; I feel like Father has no hope for me either; otherwise, why would he only let me chop vegetables? I’ve been practicing chopping for weeks, and I don’t see what’s so great about it. As long as they’re cut well enough, isn’t that enough? Why does everything need to be the same size and thickness? They’re all going to end up in our stomachs anyway; I don’t understand what the fuss is about.\nJanuary 3, Sunny\nTokyo is truly bustling! Those tall buildings and all the dazzling products nearly made me forget the injury on my hand. I forgot about Father’s disappointed gaze.\nI really am not cut out to be a chef; otherwise, how could I be foolish enough to cut my own hand?\nFather must be very disappointed in me, otherwise, why did he sigh and walk away? I’m scared, I’m scared of cooking, I’m scared of that knife, and I’m scared of Father’s disappointment in me. \nMaybe leaving my hometown, leaving that place I’m afraid of, is the only way I can find a job that truly suits me.\nJanuary 20\nSo this is life in the big city!\nIt’s completely different from the slow pace of my hometown. It only takes a few minutes to make a hamburger, and I can earn over ten thousand yen in just a few minutes!\nMy parents have to stew a single radish for hours just to earn a few hundred yen. Why do they insist on those old, traditional ways?\nTokyo is developing so fast; my parents’ old thoughts can’t keep up with the progress of the times. If I stay in that kind of place, I might never see this scene.\nFather, I must prove to you that my choice is the right one. I will definitely succeed!\nMay 6, Overcast\nTomorrow is the deadline for next month’s rent. I’ve been working as a fast-food worker for a few months now.\nEvery day I’ve been saving, but in the end, I still haven’t saved a penny. Life in the big city is rich and convenient, but things are much more expensive than in my hometown. Watching others spend thousands in one night, I can only feel envy.\nNo, I can’t go back like this, all down and out. I want to continue living here; I must prove it to Father.\nJune 2, Cloudy\nI’ve really seen so much money for the first time; I probably couldn’t earn this much even if I worked in the fast-food restaurant for a lifetime! I didn’t expect that little broken shop back home to be worth so much.\nBut that man is right; my parents are getting older and should rest. It would be great to hand the shop over to a professional manager and develop it into a modern chain store. But if I go back now, Father will surely scold me. This young man looks reliable, so let him talk to my parents.\nBy the way, I should send some money back to my parents so they can buy a nice apartment. They deserve to enjoy life, and this can be my filial piety.\nAugust 6, Sunny\nThe contract has been signed, and the money is in my hands, so I don’t need to work anymore.\nI didn’t expect the food at the upscale restaurant across the street to be this delicious.\nTomorrow I’m moving out of this small, shabby apartment. The nice apartment across from Ginza must be very comfortable; maybe I’ll even meet a pretty neighbor. A new life in Tokyo is about to begin!\nOctober 2, Light Rain\nHow come I’m out of money? I can’t rent this nice apartment anymore.\nI didn’t realize money could disappear so quickly. I don’t know what’s going on; prices are getting ridiculous. Everything is rising in price; even a taxi ride starts at ten thousand yen. I’m getting tired of life in this big city; life at home is so much better—at least it’s relaxed and happy. How are my parents doing?\nHow is the family shop developing?\nI wonder if they bought that nice apartment to enjoy themselves? I should go back and check.\nOctober 4, Heavy Rain\nThis is impossible; this can’t be happening...\nWhere’s my shop? Where’s my home? What is a fish processing plant?\nI clearly only sold the shop; how could it involve... that contract! Damn it, why didn’t I read that cursed contract carefully? Dad, Mom, where are you??!\nIt’s all my fault; that man is a complete liar. How could I have believed his nonsense?!\nI’m sorry... I’m so sorry.\nYou must have been kicked out; I must find you!\nOctober 6, Overcast\nI finally found you. This person must have swallowed all the money I was supposed to give you, only letting you stay in such a poor-quality nursing home.\nFather, Mother, it’s all my fault; I’ve been unfilial. I ruined our hundred-year-old cooking stall.\nIt’s all my fault that you’ve become like this, so foolish. Mother, do you still recognize me? I’m ashamed.\nAh...\nFather... I’ve been away from home for so many years. Why do you only remember me practicing my knife skills? This bandage... was it what you wanted to give me back then... Father... I can’t bear it...\nI see now that you’ve never blamed me. I was too cowardly; I didn’t persist. You were right; what’s the point of learning to cook without cutting myself?!\nI’m sorry, Father; you never lost hope in me. It was I who... destroyed everything with my own hands.\nOctober 8, Cloudy\nMy parents are settled now. I’ve been regretting these days.\nRegretting that I’m afraid to pick up the knife again... regretting that I’m afraid to face... regretting that I ran away from home... regretting that I believed that man’s words... regretting that my shop ended up in my hands!\nBut what’s the use of regret? No, I must find that man who cheated me. I must take revenge for my parents! I must redeem my family’s shop!\nNovember 9, Overcast\nThat shrine maiden wouldn’t lie to me, right? She said going to the Fox Hotel by Inari Shrine would grant my wish.\nForget it, a dead horse is worth a shot. Anyway, I’ve been searching for so long without finding anything. Even if I can’t find it there, I can at least pray. I don’t know if the gods exist, but what else can I do... no matter what, please help me.",
            "Script": "After reading the diary, you all stared blankly for a long time, then slowly closed the diary. At that moment, as your eyes adjusted, you found yourselves still in the familiar inn, but with some differences.\nNo more mini-sized furniture, no beloved Gui Maru, no ice-encased rooms, no wall full of case notes, no kitchen knives or cooking manuals, and no familiar monster cards. Each room looked somewhat worn and ordinary. You gently stepped out of your room and arrived at the usual card-playing hall, as night was approaching.\n(Wind Ichiro was the first to arrive at the card-playing hall)\nWind Ichiro: It's so strange... I feel like something's off, but I can't put my finger on it. Where did everyone go? (At this moment, a woman in a tight dress, slightly worn, approached)\n(You walked over, lightly brushing the corner of A-Yu's eye, feeling a bit sad)\nWind Ichiro: A-Yu... your tail and ears... and you, why do you look a bit older all of a sudden? A-Yu: Ichiro! No, you are my Ichiro, right... where are your ears and tail?\n(They stared at each other, and then a girl in a high school uniform walked out) Snow Princess: You are... the landlady? Chef brother? Why have you changed... so much?\n(Saying this, the Snow Woman looked up at her own head and tried to create little snowflakes with her power, only to find she had lost everything—no clouds, no power)\nWind Ichiro: Is that you... Snow Princess?\n(Snow Princess was unsure whether to nod or shake her head. A middle-aged man in a suit and sunglasses approached, looking very serious)\nNopperabo: Snow Princess? Is that you? Why is your hair yellow? Isn’t your skirt too short?\nSnow Princess: You are Lord Nopperabo?! Hahaha, it's so hard for me to get used to your short head. (A-Yu and you couldn’t help but laugh at Snow Princess’s words, while Lord Nopperabo looked at her cheerful demeanor, unable to resist smiling and affectionately patted her head)\nAlthough the hall was filled with strange changes, it still radiated the warmth and laughter of the past. The four were joking with each other when they noticed a girl in a wheelchair, eyes filled with sadness, behind whom stood a man in a trench coat and a checkered hat. The man slowly pushed the girl into the hall, and the laughter abruptly ceased, leaving the entire hall in silence.\nA-Yu: Yuko? Little Yuko! Your... your legs... (A-Yu suddenly understood something and covered her face, squatting down to sob)\nWind Ichiro: Kid, are you a Sky Dog? What on earth happened? How did we all end up like this? (After saying this, you went to comfort the sad A-Yu, while Lord Nopperabo approached, looking at Yuko in disbelief) Nopperabo: You are... Yuko? How old are you? Why do I feel so... familiar with you? What happened to your legs?\n(Yuko looked down and said nothing, while the Sky Dog moved closer to adjust the blanket covering her legs) Sky Dog: Don't ask her right now... Yuko is having a hard time too. Right now, I don’t even have wings to carry her; I’ve really become useless.\nThe hall was now devoid of joy. Only oppression and sadness remained. Xiao Nuan: Everyone... want some cookies?\nEveryone looked up, gazing at Xiao Nuan, dressed in a red priestess outfit with red hair, still warm like a little sun.\nWind Ichiro: Xiao Nuan, you brought us here, right? What is going on?\n(Xiao Nuan scratched her head, about to say something, when a man in designer clothes appeared from the other side of the corridor. Upon closer inspection, his hair was gray and his face was lined with wrinkles)\nWind Ichiro: Is it you? (Is it him? The young man who once tricked you into signing a contract? How could he look so old in just a few years?)\n(The man looked at you all with a sinister gaze, full of confusion)\nNPC: You? How could you be here? And how... how is this possible? It can't be!\n(As the man pondered something, A-Yu suddenly rushed up to him, raising her hand to strike the stranger, but the man dodged swiftly and countered with a backhand, leaving five red marks on A-Yu's fair face. He then turned and kicked her down, delivering two more kicks)\nWind Ichiro: Stop it!!! (You shouted angrily, rushing forward to punch the man in the face.)\n(The man turned around viciously and punched you back, and the two started to fight. Yuko, anxious to help, fell heavily from her wheelchair.) The Sky Dog hurriedly picked up Yuko and let her sit back in the wheelchair.\nSnow Princess: 'You! Stop it!'\n(The Nopperabo glanced at the frowning Snow Princess, rushed over to separate the two, the man glared at them, then turned and went back to his room.)\nXiao Nuan: 'Everyone... well... it's pretty late now... how about we go back to our rooms and rest for the night... we can talk more in the morning?'\n(After the commotion just now, everyone was tired. You helped Ayu back to her room, and the Sky Dog pushed Yuko along. Snow Princess glanced at the Nopperabo, and they left the hall one after another, leaving only Xiao Nuan staring blankly at the table where they usually played cards.)\nAfter you sent Ayu back to her room, you hesitated, wanting to ask her what she had gone through. But finally, she shared her story: she was born in a small village, escaped from an abusive father, moved to Kyoto to make a living, and met a man who left a red mark on her face that you could only sympathize with. Ayu quietly leaned on your shoulder and slowly told you about the man; after falling in love, she became pregnant, but the man disappeared. She raised her daughter alone, but when her daughter finally turned six, she was diagnosed with leukemia. The child is now critically ill, and she has no choice but to seek the biological father's help for a bone marrow transplant to save her child. By the end of her tale, she couldn't help but cry.\nHearing this broke your heart. You grabbed Ayu's slightly trembling shoulders and said firmly, 'Ayu, I will definitely help you cure your daughter and give you a happy life. You must believe me.' You didn't care about her past; you only regretted not meeting her sooner. But you also feared that if you had met her earlier, you might not have been able to give her a sense of security or happiness. However, now you could! At least you could send that man who harmed her to meet the true Inari God! Moreover, that man had deceived you out of your family's century-old restaurant, causing your parents to end up like that! New grudges and old resentments would be settled together.\nAyu looked into your eyes and nodded, saying, 'I believe you... but please... don't do anything foolish.' You had to deceive her; you didn't want her to worry. You nodded and said you'd make her a late-night snack, telling her to stay in her room for a while. After saying that, you left Ayu's room and went to the kitchen to find something useful.\nIn the kitchen, you picked up a kitchen knife. As you grasped it, emotions surged in your heart, recalling everything you had done for Ayu at the Fox Hotel. You had slain demons and gods for her, and now back in reality, you were willing to kill her enemy. But before killing him, you had to find a way to obtain the bone marrow Ayu needed, otherwise, what would happen to her daughter?\nYou crafted a makeshift syringe in the kitchen with everything you could find. Though crude, it should work. You prepared the syringe and knife, then crossed the corridor to the man's room at the end of the corner. You found the door unlocked, so you gently pushed it open. The room was a mess, as if a fight had taken place; an ashtray lay on the floor, and the man was sprawled on the ground, eyes closed, unsure if he was alive or dead. You walked over and nudged him; there was no response. You then inserted the syringe into his knee. Perhaps due to the homemade syringe not being very professional, you struggled to draw the liquid, but you managed to extract some yellowish substance, which should be the bone marrow...\nYou wiped the tip of the syringe with a tissue, carefully placed it in a prepared box, then stabbed him several times with the knife. Confirming he was dead, you tossed the knife out the window, then carefully moved him to the hall, arranging him to look as if he was lying down, while cleaning up the blood from his room and the corridor. You worried about the body deteriorating, so you placed the box in the fridge for preservation. After doing all this, you suddenly realized this was... your first real murder... it felt strange... nausea hit you, and you rushed to the bathroom to vomit for a long time. By the time you gathered yourself, a lot of time had passed, and you remembered Ayu was still waiting for you, so you hurried to the kitchen to make a bowl of noodles to take to her room. When you entered, you found Ayu seemed to have already fallen asleep. You set the noodles aside and walked over to carefully observe this most important woman in your life, gently stroking her head, murmuring, 'Ayu, don’t worry, I will definitely help you resolve this, and I will save your daughter. Just sleep well, everything will be alright by tomorrow.' Saying this, you felt a wave of fatigue, as if shedding a heavy burden, and you also leaned against the bedside and fell into a deep sleep.",

            "Story": "Diary: January 1\nIt’s a new year, and I still haven’t become a messenger of the gods. My sister has already been a messenger for two years. I still haven’t fulfilled my promise. When will I be able to complete my vow? Great God, you will bless me, right?\nGreat God, I hope I can become a messenger this year. Great God, I hope Mom and Dad can be happy. Great God, I hope my grandparents have good health. Great God, I hope my sister is well by your side.\nGreat God, I hope everyone I meet is happy. Please!!\nJanuary 10\nToday, I met a kind couple who said they were willing to take me in. They brought me to a warm little house and said this would be my home from now on.\nHome? What kind of place is a home? Is this really my home? Do I have family now?\nThey patted my head and told me to call them Mom and Dad. I looked into their eyes in confusion and called them Mom and Dad. Suddenly, their eyes curved like little crescents, and my heart felt warm, like a small stove was lit inside me. Was it the warmth of the house, or the power of the word “family”?\nI also have a lovely sister who likes me very much; we’ll get along well!\nMarch 21\nI still want to become a messenger of the gods, and I won’t give up!\nAlthough I’ll miss my grandparents and everyone in Baihu Village, it’s time for me to leave.\nI packed my little bag and went to say goodbye to my grandparents.\nTheir hugs were so warm! I will always remember this feeling!\nThey also gave me a pack of my favorite paw-shaped cookies and reminded me to take care of myself, to eat well, not to catch a cold, to work hard to fulfill my wishes, and not to forget them. I nodded vigorously, promising I wouldn’t forget, I definitely wouldn’t!\nMarch 3\nToday, the Great Inari came to find me, asking me to guide the last person into the Fox Hotel. Haven't there already been six people?\nIt was a plump, graying man. I felt like I had seen him before; had he come here before?\nI stepped forward to ask him what wish he wanted to fulfill. Then go find the Fox Hotel. It can grant all your wishes.\nHe emitted a strange aura; as I got closer, I felt a chill throughout my body, a feeling emanating from my heart… was this… fear?\nWhy do I feel afraid?\nIt was as if my kind was warning me to stay away from him. What has he done?\nMarch 4\nI’ve been practicing hard, but I can’t wait for the next choice. Little Nuan is still waiting for me. Should I leave to seek new opportunities? I told my parents my thoughts, and they said, “Child, go pursue your dreams. Mom and Dad will always bless you. Remember, we are always here. When you’re tired, come back. Home will always wait for you.”\nI shouldered my bag, and when I stepped out of the door, my parents patted my head like when we first met, but strangely, their eyes were a little wet. I felt a bit emotional too; why?\nMarch 4\nThe Great Inari told me to enter the Fox Hotel with them. This is my final test, to help them find the power to fulfill their wishes. Can I do it?\nWhat kind of power is it?\nRecalling the troubled expressions of the previous visitors, no, Xiao Nuan wants everyone to be happy. Xiao Nuan can do it!\nApril 8\nLife in Baihu Village has been so joyful; everyone takes care of me.\nMy grandparents make delicious food for me every day, and I eat well. I also give my grandparents back massages daily.\nThey praise me every day and give me paw-shaped cookies. This feeling is so warm, like finding a second home.\nHow wonderful it is when everyone is happy~\nApril 28\nIn this place called home, I am really so happy!\nMom and Dad love me very much. They buy a lot of delicious food for me and my sister every day, and take us out to play. My sister, Meng, shares her favorite paw-shaped cookies with me.\nXiao Nuan is happy every day.\nDad Fengyan, Mom Naozi, little sister Meng, I see you! You are my favorite family!\nMay 20\nToday, I couldn’t wait any longer and asked Grandpa Village Chief.\nWhen will the selection of the messenger candidates happen? Grandpa Village Chief looked at me with a puzzled expression and said, “Wasn’t the selection just completed last year?”\nJust two days before I arrived, it had only happened once every few decades. Oh no, how could this happen? Am I destined not to become a messenger?\nDid I also make a promise?\nJune 8\nToday, the last confused person arrived; it was a girl in a school uniform with dyed hair. I looked at her, and the strange energy radiating from her was unusually strong.\nI heard her wish: “Great God, please grant me the courage to help her seek justice.”\nI approached her and asked, “Do you have a heart knot? Go to the Fox Hotel, and your wishes will be fulfilled. I will bless you here too!”\nLittle Meng: “I can see you soon!”\nJuly 1\nI have been practicing at the Inari Shrine on Inari Mountain for a while; it’s a new year again.\nWhen I shook the bell to express my wish to the Great God, a figure suddenly appeared before me. He was short, with a round belly and a tall hat.\nIsn’t this the Great Inari?\nThe Great Inari has seen me!\nThe Great Inari said he would give me a test. If I could complete his test, he would let me be his messenger!\nCould my wish finally come true?\nI will definitely complete the test well and not disappoint the Great God!\nJuly 20\nToday, I encountered another confused person, a serious man in a suit and sunglasses. He seemed very troubled and made a wish: “I hope to avenge Lingzi and find Little Cherry.”\n Reiko and Little Cherry who are they??? They must be important to him, right? I still guided him to the Fox Hotel, hoping that Lord Inari will grant them happiness!\nIt seems that I just need to stay at the shrine, and confused people will come, allowing me to help those in distress; Little Meng will be very happy too.\nAugust 2\nSummer has come, I am eating biscuits, basking in the sun, and looking at the sky missing my family.\nA familiar sense of power came from the torii gate, and a slightly worn woman walked up. She wore a sexy fitted dress and had a strong smell of alcohol. I heard her wish: hoping that the deity can let my daughter, Little Bai, grow up healthy and happy.\nShe must be a good mother... How nice it would be if she were my mother...\nMy heart felt a little sour, wondering what happened to this woman, but Lord Inari can help her!\nI guided her to the Fox Hotel. Go for it, Little Nuan, you will help more people!\nAugust 16\nToday, two confused people arrived at the same time. The girl in the wheelchair sighed, pounding her legs. Behind her was a young man in a trench coat, wearing a checkered hat, looking a bit distracted. The girl gently made a wish: hoping the deity can let her mom wake up.\nThe boy wished: hoping to help Peach uphold justice.\nI stepped forward again, leading them to the Fox Hotel to fulfill their wishes. They are really pitiful; Little Nuan felt their troubles and helplessness.\nMay the deity grant your wishes.\nAugust 16\nI'm on the road again, leaving my family for my dreams, carrying their wishes. I've heard of a mountain called Inari Mountain; if you train there, Lord Inari will see you. So this place must be very close to where Lord Inari resides, right?\nIf Lord Inari can see, can Little Meng see me too? Little Meng, look, I'm getting closer to you!\nSeptember 16\nI have been walking on the road for a long time, but no one is willing to accept me; the sun is so hot. My little paws are blistering, it hurts so much.\nShould I give up? I miss my mom and dad so much.\nNo, I can't give up; my sister is still waiting for me. Dad and Mom support me so much; how can I give up?\nI can definitely succeed. I've heard there's a white fox in this village that can produce many divine messengers at once, so if I can get to this place, I can become a divine messenger too!\nGo for it, Little Nuan! You can do it!\nOctober 30\nI finally found that white fox village; the foxes here are so kind.\nThe village chief welcomed me warmly and let me stay in the village. The village chief said there’s an old couple on the west side of the village who have no one to care for them. How pitiful; I want to help them.\nSo I told the village chief I wanted to live with the old man; he cheerfully called the old couple over, and they looked very happy.\nThey took a cookie out of their pocket and handed it to me, making me so happy; I thought of my sister. Sister, how are you? Little Nuan will definitely come to find you.\nNovember 9\nLord Inari asked me to listen to others' wishes, to find six confused or despairing people, and guide them to a place called the Fox Hotel.\nFor convenience, Lord Inari transformed me into a human form; my red fur turned into a red shrine maiden outfit, but I can't leave Inari Mountain. Can I just wait here for those confused people to arrive?\nHuh? That person has a strange power; is this... confusion?\nI approached the sunny boy in a checkered shirt and heard his wish: hoping that the deity can help me find that fraud, and let my parents become healthy. Seeing his furrowed brows, I couldn’t help but ask him, do you have any troubles? Go to the Fox Hotel; your wish will be fulfilled there.\nLooks like I've found the first confused person, with five more to go.\nNovember 15\nI've heard that Lord Inari will soon select divine messengers! I want to become a divine messenger too!\nMy sister also wants to become a divine messenger with me, so we can stay together. Little Meng, let’s work hard together!\nDecember 23\nToday I found this notebook on the road, and I should take a good look at it. Why not use it to record my journey in search of my family? Where are my family members? What are they like?\nLittle Nuan is really looking forward to it, even though it's tough now, not having enough to eat or wear. But I believe this is the test given to me by the deity; I will definitely work hard.\nGo for it, to find my family.\nDecember 25\nToday, the selection of Lord Inari's divine messengers has been completed.\nLittle Meng has become the new divine messenger; my sister is really excellent, and I'm so happy for her. I will also work hard; we had promised to become divine messengers together.\nWait for me; I will catch up with you!!!",
            "Script": "After reading the diary, you all stared blankly for a long time before slowly closing the notebook. As your eyes adjusted, you found yourselves in the familiar inn, but something felt different. \nThe mini furniture was gone, so was your beloved Guimaru. The frozen room, the wall full of case notes, the kitchen knife, and the cookbook were all absent, as well as the familiar monster cards. Each room looked somewhat shabby and ordinary. You gently walked out of your room and into the usual card-playing hall, where evening was approaching. \n(Wind Ichiro arrived first at the card-playing hall.) \nWind: It's strange; something feels off, but I can't put my finger on it. Where is everyone? (At that moment, a woman in a tight dress, with a hint of dust about her, approached.) \nAyu: Ichiro! No, you’re my Ichiro, right? Where are your ears and tail? (Wind Ichiro walked over and gently brushed Ayu’s eye corner, slightly saddened.) \nWind Ichiro: Ayu... your tail and ears are gone too... and you, how did you suddenly get older? (They looked at each other, then a little delinquent girl in a high school uniform stepped out.) Yuki: You... are you the landlady? Chef Brother? Why do you all look... different? \n(Speaking, the Snow Woman looked up at her head, trying to create little snowflakes with her power, only to find she had nothing left; the clouds and power were gone.) \nAyu, Wind Ichiro: Is that... Yuki? \n(Yuki was unsure whether to nod or shake her head when a middle-aged man in a suit and sunglasses approached, looking serious.) \nNopperabo: Yuki? Is that you? Why is your hair color yellow? Isn’t your skirt a bit short? \nYuki: You’re Lord Nopperabo?! Hahaha, your head is so short; it really throws me off. \n(Ayu and Wind Ichiro laughed at Yuki's comment, and Nopperabo couldn’t help but smile, affectionately patting her head.) \nDespite the unfamiliar changes in the hall, it was still filled with laughter and warmth, as the four teased each other until they saw a girl in a wheelchair, eyes full of sadness, with a man in a trench coat and checkered hat standing behind her. The man slowly pushed the girl into the hall, and the laughter abruptly ceased, leaving the entire hall in silence. \nAyu: Yuko? Little Yuko! Your... your legs... (Ayu suddenly understood something, covering her face and crouching down, sobbing.) \nWind Ichiro: Kid, you’re a Tengu, right? What on earth happened? Why have we all turned into this? (Wind Ichiro said as he went to comfort the sorrowful Ayu, while Nopperabo stepped forward, incredulously looking at Yuko.) \nNopperabo: You... Yuko? How old are you? Why do I feel so... familiar with you? What happened to your legs? \n(Yuko kept her head down, silent, while the Sky Dog stepped over to adjust the blanket covering her legs.) Sky Dog: Don’t ask her for now... Yuko... she’s hurting too. I don’t even have wings to fly her; I’ve truly become useless. \nThe hall was devoid of joy, filled only with oppression and sorrow. Xiao Nuan: Everyone... want some cookies? \nEveryone looked up at the sight of Xiao Nuan, dressed in a red miko outfit with red hair, warm like a little sun. \nEveryone: Xiao Nuan, did you call us here? What’s going on? \n(You scratched your head, about to say something when a chubby man in luxury brands appeared from the other side of the corridor. As he approached, you noticed his white hair and wrinkled face.) \nEveryone: It’s you. \n(The man looked at you with a harsh gaze, puzzled.) \nNPC: You? How are you here? And how... is this possible? \n(As the man pondered, Ayu suddenly rushed in front of him, raising her hand to hit the stranger, but the man quickly dodged and retaliated with a slap, leaving five red marks on Ayu’s fair face. She fell from the wheelchair. The Sky Dog quickly lifted Yuko back into her seat.) \nYuki: Stop it! \nWind: Stop it!!! (Wind Ichiro shouted and ran over, punching the man in the face.) \n(The man turned around, hitting Wind Ichiro back, and the two began to struggle. Yuko anxiously tried to help, but the man turned and kicked Ayu down, kicking her twice.) \n(Nopperabo, seeing Yuki's face scrunch up, rushed in to pull them apart. The man shot a glare at you all before turning back to his room.) \nXiao Nuan: Everyone... um... it’s getting late... how about we head back to our rooms and rest for the night... We can talk more in the morning? \n(After the commotion, everyone was tired. Wind Ichiro helped Ayu back to her room, while the Sky Dog pushed Yuko along. Yuki glanced at Nopperabo, and they left the hall in succession, leaving you staring blankly at the card table.) \nAfter everyone left, you remained in the hall, lost in thought for a long time. Memories of living together in the inn flashed before your eyes like slides. The gentle Ayu, like a mother; Nopperabo, catching bugs with you; the Sky Dog, giving you little gifts; Wind Ichiro, baking cookies and making sweet soup; Yuko, who lived with you like a sister; and your first and only friend, Yuki. Everyone felt like a real family, playing cards, drinking, and eating together at that table. Yuko, small enough to stand on the table, Nopperabo always winning at cards, Yuki sneaking glances with little snowmen, Wind Ichiro always indulging Ayu, and the Sky Dog, serious yet never taking his eyes off Yuko. \nEveryone... was family, but just now... so familiar yet strange... almost like strangers. You sighed and returned to your room, only to find a pack of paw-shaped cookies and monster cards. It turned out... the life you shared in the Fox Inn wasn't fake; it was real time spent together. Everyone had eaten your paw-shaped cookies, played monster cards with you. Tears fell from your eyes, landing on the table as you buried your face in your arms, knowing you couldn't part with everyone, with each of them. The Fox Inn could offer them a beautiful scene, a simple, happy life, but they couldn’t stay in this false dream forever... They fulfilled their wishes, found their most important things, and they had to return to bravely face their lives... \nXiao Nuan... doesn’t want to part with everyone... but... Xiao Nuan must help everyone move forward! They can’t stay in pain, hiding like ostriches! They can’t keep sealing themselves away... You wiped the tears from your face, clenched your little paw into a fist for encouragement: Xiao Nuan! Go for it! You can give everyone strength! Brave onward! Xiao Nuan will also help Inari-sama protect those pure and kind whales like Xiao Nuan, ensuring Inari-sama stays healthy and powerful to continue blessing Xiao Nuan's family!! \nXiao Nuan! Go for it!",

I am grateful to the divine for giving me this precious gift—having family means feeling warmth!\nLast New Year, it was just me and my parents. This year, it’s me, Dad, Mom, and my little sister. We added an extra pair of chopsticks at the dinner table, and there’s one more figure in the group photo. Everything seems to be getting better and better.\nMy sister is very cute; she’s like a little tail, always following me, clinging to me and calling me “sister.” Her presence adds a lot of joy to my life. When Mom and Dad aren’t around, she plays with me, which is really nice!\nBut I don’t know why, I always feel like Mom and Dad don’t care about me as much anymore... They’re not as attentive as before. Is it because of my sister?\nNo, no, I must be overthinking it!\nA new year has come~ I hope everyone I love this year can be happy and healthy! Please take care of me!!!\nFebruary 3, Sunny turning to cloudy\nI’m sad.... Why?\nWhy don’t you smile at me anymore, don’t care about me, and don’t talk to me as much? I talk a lot.\nIs it because I’m not your biological daughter? Is my brother that important?\nMom and Dad, I need you too! I also want......\nFebruary 4\nI overestimated this society; this world has turned upside down, a complete mess.\nMom and I have been running for so long. I took those papers to protest, to fight for my rights, to seek justice for my beloved fish, but... what’s the use?\nOfficials protect each other, money can smooth everything over. It’s disgusting, really disgusting.\nApril 1\nI never thought I would spend the New Year in a hospital. When I woke up, I was greeted by stark white walls, an oxygen mask, and doctors in white coats.\nI wanted to talk, wanted to get up, but I had no strength. The bed felt empty, so empty.\nThe doctor told me that on March 29, Mom and I were in a car accident. To save me, she was thrown out and became a vegetable. I miraculously survived, but my legs... have to be amputated.\nHaha, is my life joking with me?\nMom... my mom...\nI will never forget that car; it came at me on purpose.\nDeliberate murder.\nI saw it, there was a girl and a man in the car.\nI hate it so much.\nApril 2\nWhy does she have to lie? “Judge, she is lying!” “You liar, you scammer!” Liar\nLiar liar liar liar\nShe is a liar, she is lying. Judge, she is lying! It’s not like this!!!\nApril 20, Overcast\nIn the ninth year, I finally lost it. I no longer have a home.\nJune 28\nSometimes I feel like Mom is a magician; her belly is gradually swelling again. My sister asks me every day what’s in Mom’s belly, um... I’m not really sure.\nDad always listens to Mom’s belly and laughs happily, carefully touching her tummy. However, when my sister and I want to touch it, Dad stops me and picks up my sister, saying that her brother lives there.\nWhat? Isn’t he also my brother?\nWhy... won’t you let me touch it too?\nJuly 18, Sunny\nSummer has come. Unknowingly, more than half a year has passed. When I opened my diary to record, it felt a bit strange. It has been three months, and a lot has happened. For example, I accepted that my parents don’t love me.\nFor example, I left that home I once loved so much.\nFor example, they haven’t looked for me, or perhaps they don’t even intend to. And for example, I met my real mother.\nFrom the moment she saw me, the love and care in her eyes were something I had never seen in my previous mom. When she hugged me and called me “Little Cherry,” the tremor in her voice was undeniable. It was also that day I learned my name; it turns out I also had a nickname, called Cherry. It was on that day I finally understood I wasn’t an abandoned little creature but someone who got separated from my mother. She has been thinking of me all her life.\nDivine being, I am loved, right?\nIt has been almost a month since my mother took me back to the little fishing village. Our life is simple but joyful. Mom loves to take me on fishing boats. Whenever the sea has waves, a blue figure leaps over the surface. That’s a whale!\nSo, so beautiful, free, and wonderful.\nMy happiness is slowly returning. Now, I am happier than ever.\nAugust 12\nI have known Zetong Hei for 105 days.\nHe is a detective who likes to come to the convenience store at 2:30 a.m. every day to buy a cold red bean bun and two bottles of beer.\nI remember the look in his eyes when he tried to explore; he was shocked when he saw the wheelchair under me and repeatedly apologized.\nHe... is really quite nice, even though he’s just a third-rate detective, doing things like finding lost pets or investigating extramarital affairs. His health isn’t great, and he always carries a spray medication with him. However, after learning about my situation, he has been trying hard to investigate, wanting to seek justice for me and my mother who is still in the hospital. He is really putting in a lot of effort.\nBut no matter how hard he tries, it can’t compete with power.\nThe culprit appears at his house every month, laughing and joking, sending expensive luxury goods to his family. When he told me this, he held his head, feeling very guilty.\nI know, I know everything.\nSo I don’t hate him; it’s not his fault.\nAugust 16\nHe said he wants to kill that man to seek justice.\nHe said he heard that the man has appeared near Inari Shrine. He said...\nI said: Take me with you, let me meet the divine one in the end. He said: Okay.\nIf possible, please, divine one, let me be a little happier too, I beg you.\nOctober 9\nBlood... so much blood, the beach has been stained.\nI really can’t believe my eyes; the whale that once played with me freely now appears before me, its belly opened wide. I... I\nThat’s life! It’s a living life!\nThey were right in front of me, eyes wide open, crying. I heard them, I heard them! How painful it must be!\nThe brutal butchers, they killed my friend. I’m so scared; they look so fierce, like demons wandering the earth.\nNo, I can’t back down; I must avenge them! These evildoers must face their punishment.\nI’m going to Kyoto! I heard there are many organizations protecting marine life; I can definitely stop them!\nDecember 25\nToday marks the second month since my brother was born.\nMom and Dad seem to have put all their energy into him. They even decorated a nursery for him, filled with all kinds of toys that I’ve never seen before.\nOnce, I asked Dad if I could take one out for my sister and me to play with. He looked at me with a cold gaze, like a tree stabbing into my heart.\nFrom that moment, I knew that some things had changed. It’s now Christmas evening at 6:30; snow is falling outside in keeping with the season. My parents are having dinner with my brother and sister, while I am in my room writing this diary.\nThey didn’t come to call me... Snow is beautiful, but I can’t feel any happiness... I feel like I’m going to lose the home I love so much...",
            "Script": "After reading the diary, you all felt a bit dazed for a long time, then slowly closed the diary. At this moment, when your eyes adjusted again, you found that the familiar inn was still there, but with some differences.\nGone were the miniature furniture, the beloved Gui Maru, the ice-locked room, the entire wall of case notes, the kitchen knife, and the cooking book, along with the familiar monster cards. Every room looked similar, a bit worn and ordinary. You gently walked out of your room and arrived at the hall where you usually played cards. Night was approaching.\n(Kaze Ichirou was the first to arrive at the card-playing hall)\nKaze Ichirou: It's strange, I feel like something is off, but I can't put my finger on it. Where did everyone go? (At that moment, a woman in a tight dress, looking a bit worn, walked over)\nAyu: Ichirou! No, you are my Ichirou, right... where are your ears and tail? (Kaze Ichirou walked over, gently brushed Ayu's eye corner, a hint of sadness in his expression)\nKaze Ichirou: Ayu... your tail and ears too... and you, how did you suddenly look a bit older? (The two looked at each other, then a girl in a high school uniform appeared) Yuki: You are... the landlady? Chef brother? Why do you look... different?\n(Saying this, Yuki looked up at her own head, wanting to use her powers to create little snowflakes, but realized she had lost everything, the dark clouds and powers were gone)\nAyu, Kaze Ichirou: You are... Yuki?\n(Yuki didn't know whether to nod or shake her head. Behind her, a middle-aged man in a suit and sunglasses approached with a serious expression)\nNopperabo: Yuki? Is that you? Why is your hair yellow? Is your skirt too short?\nYuki: You are Lord Nopperabo?! Hahaha, your head being so short is really hard for me to get used to.\n(Ayu and Kaze Ichirou burst out laughing at Yuki's comment, and Nopperabo couldn't help but smile at Yuki's cheerful demeanor, affectionately patting her head)\nAt this moment, although the hall was filled with unfamiliar changes, it still resonated with the laughter and warmth of the past inn. The four were joking with each other when they saw a girl sitting in a wheelchair, her eyes filled with sadness, and behind her stood a man in a trench coat with a checkered hat. The man slowly pushed the girl into the hall, and the laughter suddenly ceased, leaving the entire hall in silence.\nAyu: Yuko? Little Yuko! Your legs...\n(Ayu suddenly understood something, covering her face and squatting down to sob)\nKaze Ichirou: Kid, you are a Tengu, right? What the hell is going on? How did we all end up like this?\n(After Kaze Ichirou spoke, he went over to comfort the grieving Ayu, while Nopperabo stepped forward, looking incredulously at Yuko)\nNopperabo: You are... Yuko? How old are you? Why do I feel so familiar with you? What happened to your legs?\n(Yuko lowered her head and said nothing, and the Tengu behind her walked over to adjust the blanket covering her legs) Tengu: Don't ask Yuko any more questions, she is also very upset. Right now, I don’t even have wings to take her flying, I’ve really become useless.\nThe hall was now devoid of joy. All that remained was repression and sadness. Xiao Nuan: Everyone... want some cookies?\nEveryone looked up at the sight of Xiao Nuan, wearing a red shrine maiden outfit and having red hair, still warm like a little sun.\nYuko: Xiao Nuan, you called us here, right? What is going on?_\n(Xiao Nuan scratched her head, just about to say something when a fat man in designer clothes appeared from the other side of the corridor. Upon closer inspection, he had white hair and a face full of wrinkles)\nYuko: It’s you! (It's him!!! You will never forget this face; it was the one in the driver's seat that night, the murderer who harmed you and your mother!!!)\n(The man looked at you, his gaze fierce and filled with doubt)\nNPC: You? How did you get here? And how... how is this possible? It can't be!\n(As the man pondered something, Ayu suddenly rushed in front of him, raising her hand to hit the stranger, but the man dodged, then retaliated with a backhand slap, leaving five red fingerprints on Ayu's fair face. He then turned and kicked Ayu down, kicking her twice)\nKaze Ichirou: Stop it!!! (Kaze Ichirou shouted and rushed over, throwing a punch at the man’s face.)\n(The man viciously turned and punched Kaze Ichirou back, and the two began to grapple.) You desperately wanted to rush in to help, but you fell heavily from the wheelchair. The Sky Dog quickly picked you up and set you back in the wheelchair.\nSnow Princess: 'You! Stop it!'\n(The Nopperabo glanced at Snow Princess, whose face was scrunched up, and rushed in to pull the two apart. The man shot a glare at you all before turning back to the room.)\nXiao Nuan: 'Everyone... um... it’s getting pretty late... how about we head back to our rooms and rest for now... we can talk more in the morning?'\n(After the ruckus earlier, everyone was tired. Weiichiro helped A-Yu back to their room, and the Sky Dog pushed you along. Snow Princess looked at the Nopperabo, and they both left the hall one after the other, leaving only Xiao Nuan staring blankly at the card table in the hall.)\nThe Sky Dog wheeled you back to your room, then gently lifted you and placed you on the bed, tucking you in. You looked at the boy before you, the familiar little detective Zetong Hei from your memories. Your days at the inn felt like a dream, but those memories occupied your mind. You gently tugged at his shirt and whispered, 'Aze... are you going to find him? You know the law can't punish him. You're going to seek your own justice, right?'\nThe boy didn’t dare to look you in the eye, nodding softly, 'Peach, don’t worry about me. Just stay here in the room and get some sleep. When you wake up, I’ll be back.' You pulled on his hand firmly, seriously saying, 'Don’t do anything reckless. You’re the only one I can rely on now. Promise me you’ll come back safely, okay?' The boy nodded, tucked in your blankets, and left.\nYou lay in bed wide awake, staring at the ceiling. The alley that night, the headlights of the car, your mother's screams—everything lingered in your mind. The hatred inside you grew stronger; that swordsman was just within reach! You wanted to take revenge for your mother and yourself! Your mind was consumed by hate, and without a thought, you tried to rush forward, but stumbled and fell off the bed.\nAt that moment, reality hit you, and you regained your sanity. You were just a cripple; you couldn’t even stand, let alone seek revenge. Your emotions finally broke down, and you cried uncontrollably. You hated yourself for being so weak, not even as strong as a ten-centimeter doll! You cried while hitting your legs, hoping the pain would wake up your senses, but you felt nothing.\nAt that moment, you seemed to hear someone at the door, but there was no knock. After a long silence, the footsteps faded away. Who was it? Why didn’t they knock? Could it be... the Yuki-onna? You recognized her the moment you saw her in the hall—she was the girl who committed perjury in court. Why was she here? You wanted to take the opportunity to ask her, but you couldn’t do anything right now.\nYou finally cried yourself out and slumped down by the bed. Aze hadn’t returned; he had been gone for a long time... Just when you started to worry, the door gently opened, and Aze came back. He was out of breath, his hair and clothes a bit disheveled. When he saw you sitting on the floor, he rushed to your side, picked you up, and set you back on the bed. As he adjusted the blankets, he said, 'Silly, why are you crying? Did I make you worry? I’m back now.' \nYou wanted to ask him what he had done, what happened to that man, but you ultimately just grabbed his shirt and said, 'Aze, can you stay here and keep me company?' Zetong Hei nodded gently and sat by the bed, stroking your head.\nWhether it was because he was with you or because you were really tired, you gradually felt sleepy. Aze gently held your hand and softly said, 'Sleep peacefully, Peach. I’m here, so don’t be afraid.' Listening to his words, you drifted off to sleep.",

            "Story": "Diary: February 13, Light Rain\nWith a “bang!,” Mom turned off the TV.\n“I knew you’d be watching TV all night! It’s three in the morning. What are you waiting for? For your dad to come back? Men are just emotionless animals!”\nMom fell asleep on the sofa, and I covered her with a blanket. Her heavy makeup hadn’t been washed off. I picked up the three-year anniversary photo on the coffee table; the burn on my hand was clearly visible.\nThat was my first time trying to make soup. I had never met Dad; Mom seemed more like a child needing care, and I was all she had.\nI took off her high heels, tiptoed to her bag, and took out 100 yen. I’ll make Mom egg soup tomorrow; this money is enough to buy two eggs.\nHolding the money, I climbed back into bed and set my alarm for an early wake-up.\nMarch 29\nThis man named Koji seems to really like me and has agreed on a reasonable long-term price. This is the fourth month he’s been giving me money.\nToday, he was especially happy.\nHe wanted to take me for a drive at night. The wind was strong, and as we drove, his phone rang.\nAfter talking for about ten seconds, his expression turned serious. He hung up and immediately turned around, turning into a dark alley.\nSuddenly, a mother and daughter appeared in front of the car. He slammed the gas pedal, aiming straight for them. There was a “bang,” and one of them fell.\nI was too scared to move. “Did you... did you hit someone??”\nHe was silent, quickly reversing the car and running over them again. I couldn’t take it anymore and was about to jump out.\nHe glanced at me, coldly pulled out a stack of dollars, took out a gun, and coldly said, “Choose.”\nWhat should I do? What should I do? What should I do…\nApril 2\nThe trial began. As a party involved in the traffic case, I still attended. “I’m sorry, I really need the money. I’m really afraid of dying.”\n“I’m just a middle school girl; what can I choose in front of a gun?”\n“The brakes were broken; I accidentally hit someone. I can testify.” After saying that, I thought of the scapegoat he arranged for me: “It’s him; he’s the driver.”\nI couldn’t look at the wronged man, turning my head away. In the plaintiff's seat, I saw a girl in a wheelchair, wearing a white dress, her lips pale and seemingly weak. But her eyes, filled with resentment and anger, stared at me.\nIs she the little girl who survived that day? I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry... I couldn’t look her in the face; my face felt hot and painful.\nMay 14\nSummer is approaching, and I’ve moved to a new city. With that money, I attended the best prestigious school in this city for a year and then advanced to the high school section of the prestigious school.\nIn two years, I’ll have to take the college entrance exam.\nI must work hard to learn painting.\nLooking at my sketchbook filled with Sailor Moon drawings, flashes of images always appear in my mind: that dim paper, that girl in the white dress in a wheelchair.\nI want to be the Sailor Moon who upholds justice, but I ended up becoming the villain who gets defeated by Sailor Moon...\nOn the last page of my sketchbook, I repeatedly wrote “I’m sorry... but what good is it? What good is it for that girl...?”\nI don’t want to be weak anymore. I want to go back. Even if I can’t uphold justice for her, I want to find that old man, even if it’s just to make him pay more so that the girl can live a little better. But where can I find him?\nJune 1, Sunny to Cloudy\nToday is Children’s Day, but Mom won’t be back until midnight.\nI watched Sailor Moon on TV; I love them. They can transform and have powerful energy. I silently made a wish: “I want to be Sailor Moon!!”\nJune 8, Cloudy\nI finally contacted Kami; maybe I can get information about that man from her. After a long time, I received a message: “Inari Shrine.”\nPerhaps here, I can find the answers I want.\nNo matter what, I have to find that person.\nI packed lightly and walked toward the Inari Shrine.\nSince I’m at the shrine, I might as well make a wish. I wished at the shrine: I hope to find that man and help that girl get justice.\nThen I aimlessly searched for that man. Just as I reached a big tree, a shrine maiden in a red outfit suddenly jumped out, stared at me, and slowly said, “Go to the Fox Hotel; there you will find the answers you seek.”\nWho is she? Should I listen to her?\nWhere is this place, and what is the Fox Hotel? But now it seems there’s no other choice! No matter; it can’t get any worse. I held the Sailor Moon charm in my hand.\n'I'm sorry, this time, I'll muster the courage to seek justice for you!'\nAugust 12\nThe tuition for the new semester is getting more and more expensive, and I can't bear to ask the neighbor for money again. But the part-time job doesn’t cover it either; looking at the numbers on the blackboard, I don't know what to do.\nI sat in the alley smoking, unsure of what to do. If I don’t go to school, I won’t be able to learn to draw. My mind is filled with hand-drawn pictures of Sailor Moon; I want to learn to draw, I want to go to school, even if it’s in this worst middle school.\nJia Mei walked over, her smoky eye makeup particularly heavy today. Blowing smoke rings, she said to me, 'Short on cash? Want a quick way to make money?'\nI looked up; her eyes were filled with disdain. She leaned in and whispered, 'Companionship; one night, 10,000 yen. If you do well, you can make quite a bit in one night.'\nI looked at her; 10,000 yen—that’s enough to buy the complete set of markers. I clenched my fist and nodded at her.\nThat night, I followed her to a bar, a hazy atmosphere filled with whistling, arguing, and moaning… until I saw a fat, balding uncle. He approached me, squinting his eyes, scrutinizing my rough hands as he roamed over my body, then pulled out a stack of yen and slapped it on the table.\nThat was what I wanted! So, I walked into his room…\nAugust 13, sunny\nToday, I heard that Miyuko is going to school. She is my neighbor. Shouting loudly, 'This backpack is so ugly! I don't want it!'\nI envied her as I picked up the backpack she threw away, wanting to sneak it back. The backpack had my favorite Sailor Moon design on it. Miyuko’s mom came over. 'Nana, do you want to go to school?'\nHearing this, I couldn't help but cry out, nodding through my sobs.\nIn this slum, everyone knows I don't have a father. My mom is a hostess, and no one has abandoned me; instead, they have always taken care of me.\nMiyuko's mom gave me a new backpack and helped me pay the tuition. I can finally go to school!\nSeptember 7, cloudy\nToday is my first day reporting to middle school.\nI chose to sit in the corner; the injury on my hand started to hurt again. That night when my mom came back, she packed up all her luggage. I asked her where she was going.\nShe patted my head and handed me an envelope.\nI opened it to find 600 yen and a letter: 'Nana, take care of yourself. Mom needs someone to take care of her too.' \nShe was leaving me. I cried out, grabbing her luggage from her hand. 'Mom…'\nA man appeared at the door, balding and hunched over. He rushed up, pushed me aside, and pulled my mom away.\nI will never forget, I clutched my mom's hem, begging her not to abandon me, but she got into that man's car without looking back. The injury on my hand began to hurt.\nFrom then on, I knew I would never have even a little bit of spending money. From now on, I had to live on my own.\nGo for it, Nana!!!\nOctober 3, light rain\nNo one likes me; I have no friends, but I don’t care. I have no extracurricular life.\nRecently, I need to buy a lot of review materials, so I have to find another job. That way, I can wash dishes during the day and do handicrafts at night to pay for next semester’s tuition in advance.\nI’ve already distanced myself from them, so why do they bully me? They cornered me in the girls' restroom, pulling my hair and calling me an unwanted wild child.\nThey burned my skin with cigarette butts, spat at me, and finally left when they got tired of laughing, cursing, and hitting.\nWhy am I being bullied even though I’m already so humble? Is it just because I’m different from them?\nI envy them for being able to protect themselves and bully others. And I don’t want to be bullied anymore! I want to become like them.\nDecember 20, heavy snow\nLife has become a container for me, a living corpse. As soon as school ends, my phone will ring incessantly, and I have to choose one of the numbers to answer.\nThat’s my source of living expenses.\nIn addition to markers, I also have new branded clothes, bags, and the complete Sailor Moon set.\nTonight I met a man; his hair was graying at the temples, and he had a big belly, dressed in designer clothes and serious. He’s a company president, supposedly a famous chairman, doing business I don’t understand. His luxury car stopped in front of me, and I hesitated for a moment…",
            "Script": "After reading the diary, you all stared blankly for a long time, then slowly closed the diary. At that moment, as you focused again, you found yourselves in the familiar inn, but something felt off. \nNo more mini-sized furniture, no beloved Gui Maru, no frozen room, no wall full of case notes, no kitchen knife and cooking guide, and no familiar monster cards. Each room looked similar, a bit worn and ordinary. You gently walked out of your room and arrived at the hall where you usually played cards. It was close to night. \n(Wind Ichirou was the first to arrive at the card hall) \nWind Ichirou: It's strange... I feel like something is wrong, but I can't pinpoint it. Where did everyone go? (At this moment, a woman in a tight dress, with a hint of dust about her, walked over) \nAyu: Ichirou! No, you are my Ichirou, right...? Where are your ears and tail? (Wind Ichirou walked over and gently stroked Ayu's eye corner, slightly sad) \nWind Ichirou: Ayu... your tail and ears are gone too... And you, why have you suddenly aged a bit? (They looked at each other, then a high school girl appeared) \nYuki Hime: You are... the landlady? Chef brother? Why do you look... different? \n(Speaking, the Snow Woman looked up at her head, wanting to create little snowflakes with her powers, only to find she had nothing left, no dark clouds or powers) \nAyu, Wind Ichirou: Is that... Yuki Hime? \n(You don’t know whether to nod or shake your head, when a middle-aged man in a suit and sunglasses approached, looking serious) \nNopperabo: Yuki Hime? Is that you? Why is your hair color yellow? Isn’t your dress too short? \nYuki Hime: You are Lord Nopperabo?! Hahaha, your head is so short, it really feels strange. \nAyu and Wind Ichirou laughed at Yuki Hime's words, and Lord Nopperabo, seeing her cheerful demeanor, couldn't help but smile and affectionately pat her head. \nThough the hall was filled with strange changes, it still brimmed with laughter and warmth like the inn of old. The four were joking with each other when they saw a girl in a wheelchair, her eyes filled with sadness, and behind her stood a man in a trench coat with a checkered hat. The man slowly pushed the girl into the hall, and laughter abruptly stopped, plunging the hall into silence. \nAyu: Yuko? Little Yuko! Your... your legs... (Ayu suddenly understood something, covering her face and squatting down, sobbing) \nWind Ichirou: Kid, you are a Tengu, right? What is going on? How did we all become like this? After saying that, Wind Ichirou went to comfort the sad Ayu. Lord Nopperabo stepped forward, looking incredulously at Yuko: You are... Yuko? How old are you? Why do I feel so... familiar with you? What happened to your legs? \nYuko lowered her head in silence, and the man behind her adjusted the blanket covering her legs. Tengu: Don’t ask her for now... Yuko... she’s having a hard time too. I... I have no wings to fly her with anymore; I’ve truly become useless. \nAt that moment, the hall was devoid of joy. Only oppression and sadness remained. Xiao Nuan: Everyone... want some cookies? \nEveryone raised their heads, looking at Xiao Nuan, who appeared in front of them, dressed in a red miko outfit with red hair, still warm like a little sun. \nYuki Hime: Xiao Nuan, you called us here, right? What’s going on? \nXiao Nuan scratched her head, about to say something when a fat man dressed in designer clothes appeared from the other corridor. As he got closer, they saw his hair was graying and his face was covered with wrinkles. \nYuki Hime: It’s you! (The man in front of them was the same devil who forced her to lie with a gun back in the day; in just two years, he had aged so quickly.) \nThe man looked at you, his eyes fierce and confused. \nNPC: You? How are you here? And how... how is this possible? \nThe man was deep in thought when Ayu suddenly charged in front of him, raising her hand to hit this stranger, but the man swiftly dodged, then countered with a palm strike, producing a loud sound as five red fingerprints appeared on Ayu's fair face. Then the man turned, kicked Ayu down, and kicked her twice more. \nWind Ichirou: Stop it!!! \nYuki Hime: You all! Stop it! \nWind Ichirou shouted and rushed over, punching the man in the face. (The man retaliated with a punch to Wind Ichirou, and they began to wrestle. Yuko anxiously tried to rush to help but fell heavily from her wheelchair.)  The Sky Dog quickly picked up Youzi and helped her back into the wheelchair.\nThe Nopperabo glanced at you, whose little face was all wrinkled up, rushed over to pull the two apart. The man glared at you and turned back into the room. Xiao Nuan: “Everyone... well... it’s pretty late now... why don’t we go back to our rooms to rest?—Let’s talk again tomorrow morning, okay?”\nFeng Yilang helped A Yu back to the room, and the Sky Dog pushed Youzi away as well. You glanced at the Nopperabo; he followed you out of the hall, leaving only Xiao Nuan, staring blankly at the usual card game table in the hall. After that commotion, everyone was tired, and after returning to the room, you slumped onto the bed, your heart unsettled for a long time. The girl in the wheelchair... you could never forget the look in her eyes during that trial, the way she looked at you. The guilt inside you was nearly drowning you. And that man, the one who handed you a gun and a wad of cash, making you choose, the damn man who put the blame on you!\nYou hesitated for a long time, taking out the sketchbook you had in your bag. You looked at the Sailor Moon characters with their sunny smiles, their brave postures representing justice, and on the last page, the countless apologies you had written over the years. You gathered your courage and got up to leave the room. You were determined to find that girl and explain what happened back then, to tell her that after you got out, you would help her clear her name, admit that you had committed perjury, even if you had to take on legal responsibility, even if she yelled at you or hit you. As long as you could help her reclaim her delayed justice, as long as she could forgive you.\nYou walked out the door and ran into a man in a trench coat at the corner; it should be... the Sky Dog. You saw him storm angrily to the end of the corner and then go through a door. You realized that directly opposite him was the man’s room. You hesitated for a moment, unsure whether to go look for that man, but deep inside you were still fearful. Afraid of that dark gun barrel and his cold, harsh gaze. After steadying yourself, you took a few steps forward to the girl's door; just as you were about to knock, you heard crying from inside. You stopped your hand from knocking and gently pressed it against the door to listen.\nYou heard the girl inside crying in despair, pounding on something as she shouted, “Why! Why me! Why am I a waste!!! I can’t do anything... Whale, Mom, myself... I can’t do anything right... I can’t protect anything...” You froze; now wasn’t... the right time to go in. The courage you had just mustered vanished in an instant. You fled back to your room like a coward.\nOnce back in your room, you immediately burrowed into the covers, using the pillow to cover your head, as if this could give you a sense of security. You recalled the words you just heard, filled with regret, guilt, and fear. Your heart was in turmoil; you lamented why, after gathering courage, did you run away? If only you had rushed in to comfort her, if only you could tell her what you had planned... But no matter what, you could no longer lift your feet to go to the place you had just fled from. You hated this weak, timid version of yourself, wrapping yourself tightly in the blanket, hugging your legs and softly sobbing.\nYou didn’t know how long had passed when you heard a soft knock at the door. You walked over to open it and found it was the Nopperabo. He looked at you with red eyes and asked, “Why are you crying?” Seeing his concerned gaze, you couldn’t help but break down. You cried uncontrollably. The Nopperabo watched you, at a loss, hurriedly pulling an old handkerchief from his pocket and handing it to you, saying, “Don’t cry, don’t cry. Just say what’s bothering you.” You took the handkerchief but didn’t wipe your tears; instead, you burst out laughing, “What era is it? You still carry a handkerchief? Uncle, you’re really outdated.”\nSeeing you stabilize your emotions, the Nopperabo sat you down on the bed and asked you to tell him why you were crying. After a long hesitation, you said, “I did something wrong to someone. This matter has tormented me for a long, long time. Ever since then, my life has been filled with guilt. I want to apologize to her, to make up for my mistake, but I lack the courage to face her.” The Nopperabo looked at you seriously and patted your head, saying, “Although I don’t know what you’ve been through, you look like a middle school student. It’s okay to make mistakes; everyone makes mistakes. As long as you realize your error, no matter whether the other party forgives you or not, do your best to make amends. The days ahead won’t be so painful. You’re just a bit scared; it’s okay to not be so brave. Give yourself a little more time to have a good chat with yourself. If you’re not ready now, just have a good sleep, and when the sun rises tomorrow, muster the courage to try again! Just cry a little less in the future; red eyes make you look like a rabbit, and that’s not good.”\nYou nodded, handed his handkerchief back, and said, “I don’t need this anymore; I won’t cry again.” After saying that, you obediently burrowed back into the blanket.\nHe watched you lie down and then gently left. You closed your eyes, feeling as if the clouds that had shrouded your heart were beginning to dissipate. If the sun came out tomorrow, would the sunlight really be able to penetrate the clouds in your heart? Lost in thought, you fell into a deep sleep.",

    "show": "【The Arrival of the Divine】\nAfter a puff of smoke, a figure with a big belly and a tall hat appeared at the entrance of the divine realm, accompanied by a fox and a raccoon holding fans to fan him vigorously.\nDivine Messenger (deliberately fanning harder, the more the better)\nInari God (smiling, flipping back his cloak, turning to the fox and whispering, \"Can you fan gently? I can’t hear anything!\" Then sitting formally in his position): I am the main deity worshipped in the Kyoto area, Inari God. (Nods and smiles)\nDivine Messenger: Let’s give a round of applause! (Fanning even harder)\nInari God: (waving his hand to signal everyone to stop applauding, then angrily yelling at the fox, \"Can you fan gently? I can’t hear!\" ) I have come down recently for the so-called matter, to find a new divine messenger to return with me to the divine realm to take over from this (with the raccoon, two of them) fool behind me. As you can see, these two have been fanning poorly for five hundred years. I have finally endured until they should retire; my heart is very relieved. Let me see who is here today. (Looks around and sees the monster cards on the table) Hmm, they all look quite pleasing. Oh? You also play these monster cards? Just in time, I have recently developed a liking for these monster cards, but these two fools behind me play so poorly that I have never experienced the joy of losing. Since that’s the case, let’s use these monster cards to select a divine messenger today. (Turns to the fox and whispers: There are too many people, what if I can’t win? The fox whispers back: Yes, your card skills are so... good, why not... let them play first?) Ahem, I am a bit tired now, I will return to my room to rest for a while. You seven can play 3 rounds first, and after determining 3 winners, come to the adjacent room to compete with me! The winners will be taken back as new divine messengers! (Exits the room)\nDivine Messenger: Huh, that fat guy finally left; you have no idea how we have endured this for five hundred years! Playing cards so poorly, and getting angry when losing! Really difficult to serve! Ah, forget it, I will retire soon anyway. Let me see which unlucky soul will take over my position and fan for him; you will be the ones suffering. Alright, oh? You have already sorted out the monster cards on the table? Then let’s each take a stack and start; if he doesn’t play, then the extra portion will be set aside to increase the difficulty for you. Alright, let’s go, as per international practice, let’s determine who the unlucky one is~ Black and White~~~\nInari God (fake, act a bit rough, to differentiate from previous behavior): Ahem.\nDivine Messenger: Oh? My Lord, why are you back? Did you want to join in the fun and play a round?\nInari God (nods, doesn’t speak, roughly sits down and takes the last stack of cards on the table): Let’s begin.\nAyu: Does the Lord want to play too? Then let the Lord start first.\nInari God: Alright~ but we still need to select an unlucky one (looks to the left at the Sky Dog), it’s you, the unlucky one. (Gives him the extra two cards)\nSky Dog: So I’m the first to play, right? Good! (Draws a card from his hand and says to the Nopperabo) This is the Yatagarasu! Do you believe it?\nNopperabo: Hmph! Cunning Sky Dog! Not a word you say will I believe, I don’t believe! (After looking at the card, puts it back in his hand, pretending to think for a moment)\nNopperabo: (takes out the Yatagarasu from his hand and covers it, saying to Xiao Nuan) Yatagarasu, little girl?\nXiao Nuan: I believe it! Uncle Nopperabo! (Takes the card, looks at it, and then puts it into her hand to shuffle)\nXiao Nuan: Hehehe~ a pair of Yatagarasu (takes out a pair of Yatagarasu to play)\nXiao Nuan: (then takes out a Kappa card and hands it to Ayu, saying) Sister Ayu! This is a Kappa! I’m not lying to you!\nAyu: Xiao Nuan said~ Sister certainly~~~~ doesn’t believe~~ (takes the card from Xiao Nuan and puts it into her hand)\nAyu: Clever little one~~ a pair of Kappas~ (plays out 2 Kappa cards)\nAyu: (takes a card from her hand, a Yama-otoko, and says to Kazuo) Kazuo~ this card is a Yama-otoko~~\nKazuo: What Ayu said! Of course, I believe it! I believe! (Takes a look at the card, puts it into his hand)\nKazuo: (plays out 3 Yama-otoko cards, then starts thinking) Hmm~ I will play 3 Yama-otoko!\nKazuo: Then I will give Yuuko... let’s go with this! (Draws a Yatagarasu from his hand and says to Yuuko) Yatagarasu!\nYuuko: Kazuo, you are the best at trickery! I don’t believe you~~ (Takes the card Kazuo played, examines it, then humph! Puffs up!)\nYuuko: (Puts the card into her hand, takes out a Kappa and says to Yuki) Then what I’m playing is~! Kappa!\nYuki: I believe (takes the card to check, then puts it into her hand)\nYuki: A pair of contracts. (Plays out a pair of Kappa)\nYuki: (takes out a card【Kappa】to cover it, asking Inari God) My Lord, this card is a Zashiki-warashi!\nYuki: (turns and whispers secretly to Yuuko) Can I say something different from the card surface?\nYuuko: (whispers) Of course you can~,\nInari God and the Divine Messenger simultaneously look at each other, whispering: She seems to not know how to play cards!\nInari God (whispers): So should I believe or not...\nFox: Don’t believe her, she must be lying.\nInari God: No, she doesn’t know how to play; I should definitely believe her! (Happily takes the card, loudly says) I believe! (After receiving the card, frowns, puts her hand of cards together, first takes out two to hint at the fox, the fox shakes his head, then takes out three to hint at the fox, the fox shakes his head, finally which one, the fox nods. Takes that one out to cover, saying to the Sky Dog) Sky Dog, listen well, this card is! But! (trembles in pain, hand on her heart, falls down)\nDivine Messenger: Kamisama! Kamisama, what happened to you! (Rushes over to shake her). Oh no! Kamisama is out of breath! You all!! Put down your things and go to the next room immediately! Accept the investigation! (Waves both hands up and down) Alright~ now we have arrived in the next room. (Inari God can get up and say now, Inari God’s corpse is placed in the next room, I am the Raccoon Messenger)\nFox (very fierce): What’s going on!\nRaccoon (even fiercer): What’s going on! Our Inari God has been alive and well in the heavens for thousands of years, how could he lose his breath just after playing a card with you! (Fox: Exactly!) What kind of broken inn is this! I’m calling Kamisama right now! (Fox: Call!) Let the great lord issue a divine decree! Destroy this inn completely! (Fox: Destroy!) You all! Die here to accompany our lord!\nFox: Accompanying burial! ... Wait, wait! No need to all accompany burial, after all, our Kamisama is still reasonable.\nRaccoon: Reasonable? (Turns to look at the fox)\nFox: Reasonable! Ahem, you few, if you can present a culprit within two hours, we can secretly let you escape before this inn is destroyed! But the culprit must be brought back to the divine realm for trial!\nRaccoon: Did you hear! Present a culprit, and you can save your lives, but this inn! Must be destroyed! Continuing to run an inn, hum."
